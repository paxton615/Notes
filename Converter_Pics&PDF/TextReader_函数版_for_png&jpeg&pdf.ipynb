This business gave us the\\npassion of Cigars but we knew we had\\nmuch more to offer. \\n\\nThe Sampling Lounge is finished to the\\nhighest quality. We want our guests to\\ncome in and sample their chosen cigar or\\npipe, accompanied with fine spirits in the\\nwarm comfort of what will feel like your\\nliving room. \\n\\nNo.6 Cavendish is situated right in the\\nheart of London and has everything we\\nalways dreamed of, a high end luxury\\ncigar store with the largest walk-in\\nhumidor in the UK, in addition the biggest\\nindoor Sampling Lounge.   \\n\\nNot only does No.6 Cavendish specialise\\nin Cigars, but also your finest spirits and\\npipes.\\n\\nWhat makes us different from any other\\nCigar shop is our membership offerings,\\nsome of which include private keeps and\\nexclusive invitations to events.

Risks associated with investment advisory services  18.1   All forms of investment which may be recommended by us involve risk. The value of investments and the income derived from them can fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed.   18.2   Your attention is also specifically drawn to the following types of transactions which we may recommend to you and the risks associated with such transactions:   18.2.1   Non readily realisable investmentsWe may recommend investments and other assets which are not readily realisable, which means that there is no recognisedmarket for them.It may therefore be difficult to deal in such investments or to obtain reliable information about their value orthe extent of the risks to which they are exposed.  18.2.2   AIM RISK WARNING NOTICEInvestments in AIM companies may not be readily realisable and there is less liquidity in this market - if they have to be soldimmediately you may get back much less than you paid for them. The price may change quickly and may go down as well as up.   All investments into AIM or NEX Exchange shares are speculative and will fluctuate in value. It should NOT be assumed that the  value of investments will always rise. Past performance will NOT necessarily be repeated and is no guarantee of future success.   You should carefully consider in the light of your financial resources whether investing in stocks and shares is suitable for you.   AIM or NEX Exchange shares. You run an extra risk of losing money when you buy shares in certain smaller companies including    AIM/ NEX Exchange  . There is a big difference between the buying price and the selling price of these shares. If you have to sell                    4.                                                        them immediately, you may get back much less than you paid for them. You may have difficulty in selling these shares.  The price may change quickly and it may go down as well as up and it may be more difficult to buy and sell shares in this  category. You should therefore not invest amounts you cannot afford to lose.   Non-readily Realisable Investments. You may have difficulty in selling such investments at a reasonable price. In some circumstances it may be    difficult to sell them at any price. It can be difficult to assess what would be a proper market price for these investments. You should not invest in    these unless you have thought carefully about whether you can afford it and whether it is right for you.   AIM. The AIM market of the London Stock Exchange is a market designed primarily for emerging or smaller companies. The rules of this market    are less demanding than those of the official List of the London Stock Exchange and therefore carry a greater risk than a company with a full listing.   Nex Exchange is authorised as a Prescribed Market under the FSMA 2000. It is  not a recognised or designated investment exchange and    companies trading on NEX Exchange are not listed or subject to the same level of regulation as those companies trading on the AIM or those    companies with a full listing on the London Stock Exchange. It may be difficult to obtain reliable information about the current trading position of    companies on NEX Exchange and if there is only one market-maker quoting prices, there may be occasion where you may have difficulty in    buying or selling shares at a reasonable price or at all. Similarly the difference between the buying and selling prices can be wide and prices    being quoted on NEX Exchange may only be indicative prices and not firm two-way prices. Additionally, there may have been little or no trading    in the stock since its issue. Consequently, there is a higher level of risk attached to companies trading on NEX Exchange and if you have to sell    shares in these companies immediately, you may get back much less than you paid for them.18.2.3    Exchange rate riskA movement of exchange rates may affect, unfavourably as well as favourably, any gain or loss on an investment recommended by us.18.2.4  Stabilisation, Warrant and Derivatives (Options, Futures, Contract for Differences foreign exchange and Contingent Liability Transactions)We are in addition authorised to recommend transactions of the kind referred to in the following clauses of this Agreement:(a)  (b) (c)    clause 9:    Stabilisation; andclause 10:  Warrants; andclause 11:  Derivatives (Options, Futures, Contract for Differences and Contingent Liability Transactions),and your attention is drawn to   the specific risks associated with such transactions referred to therein and in Appendix B (Dealing in securities which may   be subject to stabilisation) and Appendix C (Warrants and Derivatives risk warning notice). 18.3    You acknowledge that you have read the notice set out in Appendix C and that you understand the nature of the risks which are inherentin securities trading and that you are prepared to accept these risks.19. Conflicts of interest and material interests  19.1   Your attention is drawn to the fact that if we give you advice or deal or arrange deals for you we, an associate or some other person   connected with us, may have an interest, relationship or arrangement that is material in relation to the transaction or investmentconcerned.

In all cases, you should conduct your own investigation and analysis of a potential investment before taking or not taking any action.     21.

APPENDIX B - DEALING IN SECURITIES WHICH MAY BE SUBJECT TO STABILISATIONThis statement complies with the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)SI Capital or its representatives may, from time to time, recommend transactions in securities to you, or carry out such transactions on your behalf,where the price may have been influenced by measures taken to stabilise it.You should read the explanation below carefully. This is designed to help you judge whether you wish your funds to be invested at all in suchsecurities and, if you do, whether you wish:  (1)  (2)  to be consulted before SI Capital carries out any such transaction on your behalf; orto authorise SI Capital to carry out any such transaction on your behalf without first having to consult you.What is stabilisation?Stabilisation enables the market price of a security to be maintained artificially during the period when a new issue of securities is sold to thepublic. Stabilisation may affect not only the price of the new issue but also the price of other securities relating to it.The FCA allows stabilisation in order to help counter the fact that, when a new issue comes onto the market for the first time, the price cansometimes drop for a time before buyers are found.Stabilisation is being carried out by a   stabilisation manager   (normally the firm chiefly responsible for bringing a new issue to market). As long asthe stabilising manager follows a strict set of rules, he is entitled to buy back securities that were previously sold to investors or allotted toinstitutions which have decided not to keep them. The effect of this may be to keep the price at a higher level than it would otherwise be duringthe period of stabilisation.The Stabilisation Rules:   (1)  (2)  (3)  limit the period when a stabilising manager may stabilise a new issue;fix the price at which he may stabilise (in the case of shares and warrants but not bonds); andrequire him to disclose that he may be stabilising but not that he is actually doing so.The fact that a new issue or a related security is being stabilised should not be taken as any indication of the level of interest from investors, nor ofthe price at which they are prepared to buy the securities.APPENDIX C - WARRANTS AND DERIVATIVES RISK WARNING NOTICEThis notice is provided to you, as a Retail Client, in compliance with the rules of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Retail Clients are affordedgreater protections under these rules than other clients are and you should ensure that your firm tells you what this will mean to you.This notice cannot disclose all the risks and other significant aspects of [warrants and/or ] derivative products such as futures or options orcontract for differences.You should not deal in these products unless you understand their nature and the extent of your exposure to risk. You should also be satisfied thatthe product is suitable for you in the light of your circumstances and financial position. Certain strategies, such as a spread position or a straddle,may be as risky as a simple long or short position.Although warrants and/or derivative instruments can be utilised for the management of investment risk, some of these products are unsuitable formany investors. Different instruments involve different levels of exposure to risk and in deciding whether to trade in such instruments you should beaware of the following points:1. WarrantsA warrant is a time-limited right to subscribe for shares, debentures, loan stock or government securities and is exercisable against the originalissuer of the underlying securities. A relatively small movement in the price of the underlying security results in a disproportionately largemovement, unfavourable or favourable, in the price of the warrant. The prices of warrants can therefore be volatile.It is essential for anyone who is considering purchasing warrants to understand that the right to subscribe which a warrant confers is invariablylimited in time with the consequence that if the investor fails to exercise this right within the predetermined time-scale, then the investmentbecomes worthless.You should not buy a warrant unless you are prepared to sustain a total loss of the money you have invested plus any commission or othertransaction charges.Some other instruments are also called warrants but are actually options (for example, a right to acquire securities which is exercisable againstsomeone other than the original issuer of the securities, often called a   covered warrant  ).2. Off-exchange warrant transactionsTransactions in off-exchange warrants may involve greater risk than dealing in exchange traded warrants because there is no exchange marketthrough which to liquidate your position, or to assess the value of the warrant or the exposure to risk. Bid and offer prices need not be quoted, andeven when they are, they will be established by dealers in these instruments and consequently it may be difficult to establish what is a fair price.Your firm must make it clear to you if you are entering into an off-exchange transaction and advise you of any risks involved.3. Securitised derivativesThese instruments may give you a time-limited right or an absolute right to acquire or sell one or more types of investment which is normally exercisable against someone other than the issuer of that investment. Or they may give you rights under a contract for differences which allow for speculation on fluctuations in the value of the property of any description or an index, such as the FTSE 100 index. In both cases the investment or property may be referred to as the   underlying instrument  .These instruments often involve a high degree of gearing or leverage, so that a relatively small movement in the price of the underlying investmentresults in a much larger movement, unfavourable or favourable, in the price of the instrument. The price of these instruments can therefore be volatile.These instruments have a limited life, and may (unless there is some form of guaranteed return to the amount you are investing in the product)expire worthless if the underlying instrument does not perform as expected.You should only buy this product if you are prepared to sustain a total or substantial loss of the money you have invested plus any commission orother transaction charges.You should consider carefully whether or not this product is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial position, and if in any doubtplease seek professional advice.9.  4. FuturesTransactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or to take, delivery on the underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle the position with cash. They carry a high degree of risk. The   gearing   or   leverage   often obtainable in futures trading means that a small deposit or down payment can lead to large losses as well as gains. It also means that a relatively small movement can lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the value of your investment, and this can work against you as well as for you. Futures transactions have a contingent liability, and you should be aware of the implications of this, in particular the margining requirements, which are set out in paragraph 9.5. OptionsThere are many different types of options with different characteristics subject to the following conditions.  Buying options:  Buying options involves less risk than selling options because, if the price of the underlying asset moves against you, you can simply allow the option to   lapse. The maximum loss is limited to the premium, plus any commission or other transaction charges. However, if you buy a call option on a futures    contract and you later exercise the option, you will acquire the future. This will expose you to the risks described under   futures   and   contingent liability   investment transactions  .If you write an option, the risk involved is considerably greater than buying options. You may be liable for margin to maintain your position and a loss may    Writing options:   be sustained well in excess of the premium received. By writing an option, you accept a legal obligation to purchase or sell the underlying asset if the    option is exercised against you, however far the market price has moved away from the exercise price. If you already own the underlying asset which you    have contracted to sell (when the options will be known as   covered call options  ) the risk is reduced. If you do not own the underlying asset (  uncovered    call options  ) the risk can be unlimited. Only experienced persons should contemplate writing uncovered options, and then only after securing full details    of the applicable conditions and potential risk exposure.  Traditional options:  Certain London Stock Exchange member firms under special exchange rules write a particular type of option called a   traditional option  . These may       his exposure to risk.involve greater risk than other options. Two-way prices are not usually quoted and there is no exchange market on which to close out an open position or  to effect an equal and opposite transaction to reverse an open position. It may be difficult to assess its value or for the seller of such an option to manage  Certain options markets operate on a margined basis, under which buyers do not pay the full premium on their option at the time they purchase it.In this situation, you may subsequently be called upon to pay margin on the option up to the level of your premium. If you fail to do so as required,your position may be closed or liquidated in the same way as a futures position.6. Contract for differencesFutures and options contracts can also be referred to as contract for differences. These can be options and futures on the FTSE 100 index or any other index, as well as currency and interest rate swaps. However, unlike other futures and options, these contracts can only be settled in cash. Investing in a contract for differences carries the same risks as investing in a future or an option and you should be aware of these as set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 respectively. Transactions in contract for differences may also have a contingent liability and you should be aware of the implications of this as set out in paragraph 9 below.7. Foreign Exchange Trading and Multi-Currency AccountA. Arranging Service:SI Capital will act as a professional advisor in providing the Client with an Execution Only or Advisory Foreign Exchange Trading service and although the  Clients relationship remains with SI Capital, in signing this agreement and Risk Warning Notice the Client also acknowledges that they agree in full to the terms set out within Deutsche Bank\\'s Client Agreement and High Risk Investment Risk Disclosure Notice for Foreign Exchange Margin Trading. A current version of which can be found at www.dbfx.com and also makes up part of the DBFX Foreign Exchange Margin Trading Application Form.B. General Risk:The Client understands and acknowledges that buying and selling securities, options, futures and other financial products that are denominated in foreign currencies or traded on foreign markets is inherently risky and requires substantial knowledge and expertise. Clients\\' applying for Deutsche Bank\\'s Multi-Currency enabled accounts represent that they are aware of and understand the risks involved in trading foreign securities, options, futures and currencies and that they have sufficient financial resources to bear such risks. Any investment made in products of this type of should be considered as risk capital (money that you can afford to lose) and this type of investment may not be suitable for all investors depending on personal financial circumstance and investments objectives of the individual client. If there is any doubt with regard to your suitability to invest in these types on companies then you should always seek advice from your broker or an independent professional investment advisor.C. Client Responsibility for Investment Decisions:The client acknowledges that while SI Capital are authorised to provide investment, trading advice by the FCA any losses incurred as a result of opening a Foreign Exchange trading account with Deutsche Bank remain the responsibility of the client. Past performance may not be repeated in is no guarantee of future success. Clients must evaluate carefully whether any particular investment product is appropriate for them in light of their investment experience, financial objectives and needs, financial resources, and other relevant circumstances. SI Capital are not qualified to give tax advice and we strongly recommend that Clients obtain independent business, legal, and accounting advice before entering into any transactions.Exchange rates between foreign currencies can change rapidly due to a wide range of economic, political and other conditions, exposing the Client to risk of exchange rate losses in addition to the inherent risk of loss from trading the underlying financial product.If a Client deposits funds in a currency to trade products denominated in a different currency, Client\\'s gains or losses on the underlying investment therefore may be affected by changes in the exchange rate between the currencies. If Client is trading on margin, the impact of currency fluctuation on Client\\'s gains or losses may be even greater.D. Exchange Rate Risk:E. Currency Fluctuation:When Client uses the spot foreign exchange facility provided by Deutsche Bank to purchase or sell foreign currency, fluctuation in currency exchange rates between the foreign currency and the base currency could cause substantial losses to the Client, including losses when the Client converts the foreign currency back into the base currency.F. Foreign Currency Exchange Transactions Unregulated:Spot foreign currency exchange transactions between Client and Deutsche Bank are not regulated or overseen by the FCA.10.  G. Nature of Foreign Currency Exchange Transactions Between Client and Deutsche Bank:When Client enters into a foreign exchange transaction, the client will be entering into a privately negotiated transaction with one of Deutsche Banks\\'s affiliates or with a third party bank. In such transactions, Deutsche Bank\\'s affiliate or the third party bank (  the Foreign Exchange Counterparty  ) is acting solely in the capacity of an arm\\'s length contractual counterparty in connection with the transaction and not in the capacity of a financial adviser or fiduciary. Client should be aware that the Foreign Exchange Counterparty may from time to time have substantial positions in, and may make a market in or otherwise buy or sell instruments similar or economically related to, foreign currency transactions entered into with Client.The Foreign Exchange Counterparty may also undertake proprietary trading activities, including hedging transactions related to the initiation or termination of foreign exchange transactions with Client, that may adversely affect the market price or other factors underlying the foreign currency transaction entered into with Client and consequently, the value of such transaction.H. Trades Not Executed or Cleared by an Exchange:Foreign exchange transactions executed by Client through Deutsche Bank are not executed on an exchange and are not cleared by a central clearing organization. Consequently, any foreign currency transaction contract through Deutsche Bank will be an obligation of the Foreign Exchange Counterparty (as opposed to an obligation of a clearing house as in the case of an exchange-traded contract) and Client will not be afforded the regulatory and financial protections offered by exchange-traded contracts. Moreover, the prices quoted by Deutsche Bank to Clients for foreign exchange transactions will be determined based on Foreign Exchange Counterparty quotes and are not determined by a competitive auction as on an exchange market. Prices quoted by Deutsche Bank for foreign currency exchange transactions therefore may not be the most competitive prices available. Deutsche Bank will charge transaction fees as specified by Deutsche Bank for foreign currency exchange transactions. The Foreign Exchange Counterparty will try to earn a spread profit on these transactions (differential between the bid and ask prices quoted for various currencies).I. Other Risks:There are other risks that relate to trading foreign investment products and trading foreign currencies that cannot be described in detail in this document. Generally, however, foreign securities, options, futures and currency transactions involve exposure to a combination of the following risk factors: market risk, credit risk, settlement risk, liquidity risk, operational risk and legal risk. For example, there can be serious market disruptions if economic or political or other unforeseen events locally or overseas affect the market. In addition to these types of risk there may be other factors such as accounting and tax treatment issues that Clients should consider.8. Off-exchange transactions in derivativesIt may not always be apparent whether or not a particular derivative is arranged on exchange or in an off-exchange derivative transaction. Your firm must make it clear to you if you are entering into an off-exchange derivative transaction.While some off-exchange markets are highly liquid, transactions in off-exchange or non transferable derivatives may involve greater risk than investing in on-exchange derivatives because there is no exchange market on which to close out an open position. It may be impossible to liquidate an existing position, to assess the value of the position arising from an off-exchange transaction or to assess the exposure to risk. Bid prices and offer prices need not be quoted, and, even where they are, they will be established by dealers in these instalments and consequently it may be difficult to establish what is a fair price.9. Foreign marketsForeign markets will involve different risks from the UK markets. In some cases the risks will be greater. On request, your firm must provide an explanation of the relevant risks and protections (if any) which will operate in any foreign markets, including the extent to which it will accept liability for any default of a foreign firm through whom it deals.The potential for profit or loss from transactions on foreign markets or in foreign denominated contracts will be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.10. Contingent liability investment transactionsContingent liability investment transactions, which are margined, require you to make a series of payments against the purchase price, instead of paying the whole purchase price immediately.If you trade in contract for differences, you may sustain a total loss of the margin you deposit to establish or maintain a position. If the market moves against you, you may be called upon to pay substantial additional margin at short notice to maintain the position. If you fail to do so within the time required, your position may be liquidated at a loss and you will be responsible for the resulting deficit.Even if a transaction is not margined, it may still carry an obligation to make further payments in certain circumstances over and above any amount paid when you entered the contract.Save as specifically provided by the FCA, your firm may only carry out margined or contingent liability transactions with or for you if they are traded on or under the rules of a recognised or designated investment exchange. Contingent liability investment transactions which are not so traded may expose you to substantially greater risks.11. Limited liability transactions12. CollateralBefore entering into a limited liability transaction, you should obtain from your firm or the firm with whom you are dealing a formal written statementconfirming that the extent of your loss liability on each transaction will be limited to an amount agreed by you before you enter into the transaction. The amount you can lose in limited liability transactions will be less than in other margined transactions, which have no predetermined loss limit.Nevertheless, even though the extent of loss will be Subject to the agreed limit, you may sustain the loss in a relatively short time. Your loss may be limited, but the risk of sustaining a total loss to the amount agreed is substantial.If you deposit collateral as security with your firm, the way in which it will be treated will vary according to the type of transaction and where it is traded. There could be significant differences in the treatment of your collateral depending on whether you are trading on a recognised or designated investment exchange, with the rules of that exchange (and the associated clearing house) applying, or trading off-exchange. Deposited collateral may lose its identity as your property once dealings on your behalf are undertaken. Even if your dealings should ultimately prove profitable, you may not get back the same assets which you deposited, and may have to accept payment in cash. You should ascertain from your firm how your collateral will be dealt with.11.  13. Commissions14. Suspensions of trading15. Clearing house protections16. InsolvencyBefore you begin to trade, you should obtain details of all commissions and other charges for which you will be liable. If any charges are not expressed in money terms (but, for example, as a percentage of contract value), you should obtain a clear and written explanation, including appropriate examples, to establish what such charges are likely to mean in specific money terms. In the case of futures, when commission is charged as a percentage, it will normally be as a percentage of the total contract value, and not simply as a percentage of your initial payment.Under certain trading conditions it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position. This may occur, for example, at times of rapid price movement if the price rises or falls in one trading session to such an extent that under the rules of the relevant exchange trading is suspended or restricted. Placing a stop-loss order will not necessarily limit your losses to the intended amounts, because market conditions may make it impossible to execute such an order at the stipulated price.On many exchanges, the performance of a transaction by your firm (or third party with whom he is dealing on your behalf) is guaranteed by the exchange or clearing house. However, this guarantee is unlikely in most circumstances to cover you, the client, and may not protect you if your firm or another party defaults on its obligations to you. On request, your firm must explain any protection provided to you under the clearing guarantee applicable to any on-exchange derivatives in which you are dealing. There is no clearing house for traditional options, nor normally for off-exchange instruments which are not traded under the rules of a recognised or designated investment exchange.Your firm  s insolvency or default, or that of any other brokers involved with your transaction, may lead to positions being liquidated or closed out without your consent. In certain circumstances, you may not get back the actual assets which you lodged as collateral and you may have to accept any available payments in cash. On request, your firm must provide an explanation of the extent to which it will accept liability for any insolvency of, or default by, other firms involved with your transactions.SI Capital LimitedWe have read and understood the risk warning set out above.Signature   Signature               DateDateSI Capital Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.Member of the London Stock Exchange.12.  www.sicapital.co.ukHead Office:46 Bridge Street, GodalmingSurrey GU7 1HLT +44 (0)1483 413500SI Capital Ltd is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
