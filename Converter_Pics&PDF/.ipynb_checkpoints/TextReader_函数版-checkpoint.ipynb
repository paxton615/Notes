London is a special place.\\n\\nIn 1894 several founders, including Livery Companies \\nof the City of London, helped to establish an institute to \\nsupport the education and welfare of its local community.\\n\\nOver 125 years later, with the Lord Mayor of London as \\nour Rector, we remain true to our roots as the university \\nof the City of London, committed to academic excellence  \\nfor business and the professions.\\n\\nFor over a century, our academics and students have \\nused education, research and enterprise to transform \\ntheir lives, their communities and the world.\\n\\nIn recent years we have invested heavily in our academic \\nstaff, our estate and infrastructure and have almost \\ntripled the proportion of academic staff producing  \\nworld-leading or internationally excellent research.\\n\\nIn 2016, to signal our improved academic standing, \\nwe joined the University of London and this has further \\nstrengthened the diverse, academically excellent \\nenvironment we provide.\\n\\nIn 2020, following news of Sir John Cass' historic links to \\nthe slave trade, we announced that our Business School \\nwould no longer be known as the Cass Business School. \\nTo continue using the Cass name would have been \\nincompatible with our values and our firm commitment \\nto promoting diversity and inclusion. It will be known \\nsimply as the Business School while consultation on the \\nnew name takes place.\\n\\nWith over 160 student nationalities, City is a place that \\nwelcomes everyone. We have dedicated services to cater \\nfor the needs of our students from the moment they \\napply to long after they leave us. Our award-winning \\nStudent Centre helps ensure our students make the most \\nof their time with us. It supports them with academic  \\nand financial advice and helps with any issues they  \\nmay have with their physical and mental health. \\n\\nThere are many reasons why students choose City, one  \\nof them being our location in the heart of London, one  \\nof the world's most opportunity-filled cities. \\n\\nTurn the page and take the first step.\\n\\nProfessor Sir Paul Curran \\nPresident\\n\\n\\x0c4\\n\\n Research with  \\nglobal impact...\\n\\nCharacterised by excellence, creativity and collaboration,  \\nCity\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research pedigree spans more than a century and  \\ncontinues to change lives across the globe.\\n\\nHarnessing the power of 70 specialist research centres, City \\nis committed to addressing the critical issues facing the world \\ntoday and is making a practical difference through expert \\nanalysis, inspiring partnerships and measurable action.\\n\\nFrom tackling an alarming \\xe2\\x80\\x98new nutrition reality\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sweeping  \\nthe planet to improving the lives of young Londoners, read \\non to discover just a handful of the many ways in which \\nresearch at City is having an impact, locally and globally.\\n\\n\\x0c Research with  \\n\\nglobal impact...\\n\\n\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBe a global citizen.

These \\nproblems are occurring at the same time across \\nSub-Saharan Africa, south Asia and east Asia and \\nthe Pacific. To shine light on how to address these \\ntwo aspects of malnutrition more effectively, I \\nrecently co-authored a report published in a special \\nseries on The Double Burden of Malnutrition in \\nThe Lancet. In the article I proposed and explored \\na new \\xe2\\x80\\x98double-duty\\xe2\\x80\\x99 approach to help reduce \\nundernutrition and obesity at the same time.\\n\\nUnderstanding the issues\\nOur article identified some powerful opportunities \\nto introduce double duty actions that will achieve \\npositive results. These range from improved antenatal \\ncare and breastfeeding practices to social welfare \\nand new agricultural and food system policies with \\nhealthy diets as their primary goal. While my research \\nshowed the evidence is there, moving to action is \\nalways a challenge. Yet truly to address the double \\nburden of malnutrition, we need, as put by one of my \\nco-authors and the Director of Nutrition at the World \\nHealth Organization, Dr Francesco Branca, \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwithout a \\nprofound food system transformation, the economic, \\nsocial and environmental costs of inaction will hinder \\nthe growth and development of individuals and \\nsocieties for decades to come\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. \\n\\nInspiring change\\nThe importance of shaping an effective food system  \\nis core to the Centre for Food Policy\\xca\\xbcs work. The \\nworld is facing major food system challenges, locally, \\nnationally and globally. Our vision is to see food \\npolicy addressing these challenges to improve the \\nwellbeing of people and planet. Our work involves \\nproviding independent, interdisciplinary evidence and \\neducation to enable food policy to be more effective \\nand equitable. As for my study in The Lancet, we root \\nour research in findings from the field \\xe2\\x80\\x94 learning from \\npeople at all levels of the food system: from producers \\nto policymakers, consumers to suppliers, industry  \\nto activists. \\n\\nProfessor Corinna Hawkes\\nDirector of the Centre for Food Policy\\n\\nFind out more\\nwww.city.ac.uk/pgmalnutrition\\n\\n\\x0c6\\n\\n ...begins with  \\n local effort\\n\\nKeeping Britain moving during  \\nextreme weather\\nIn 2018, I led City\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Structural Aerodynamics group in a study \\nthat sheds light on driving accidents in high wind conditions. \\nFocusing on the Orwell Bridge in Ipswich, we identified new \\nmeasures that could help to keep bridges open to traffic during \\nwindy weather.\\n\\nThe Orwell Bridge opened in 1982 and carries 60,000 vehicles a day. \\nSince 2013, the bridge closed on 18 occasions due to high winds. \\nUsing new techniques designed specifically for the Orwell Bridge, we \\ndeveloped a code called MDyn, which will have applications beyond \\nthe life of the project. My team also created a more detailed picture \\nof the ways in which wind speeds affect different types of vehicles \\non the bridge. \\n\\nWe considered more than 2,000 different combinations of turbulent \\nwind speeds, driving velocities and pavement qualities among other \\nimportant factors for vehicle safety. The work was complemented  \\nby more than 36,000 calculations based on the static equilibrium  \\nof vehicles with different size, weight, speed and wind intensities \\nand directions.\\n\\nProposing practical solutions\\nReducing the speed limit over the bridge during high winds, using \\ntemporary lane closures and keeping the bridge open in one direction  \\nwere three potential solutions identified in the year-long study. As \\npart of the project, I worked with Dr Chetan Jagadeesh, Lecturer in \\nMechanical Engineering and Aeronautics at City, to explore how the \\nposition of the vehicles and the parapets on the bridge\\xe2\\x80\\x99s deck affect \\ndriving stability. This enabled us to develop a new type of wind \\nbarrier to protect bridges and the vehicles that travel on them.\\n\\nWe hope that the insights we have gained into the forces that affect \\ndrivers crossing the Orwell Bridge and the practical steps that can \\nbe taken to keep the bridge open safely in windy weather will help \\nimprove road safety across the UK and beyond.\\n\\nDr Alfredo Camara \\nSenior Lecturer in Structural Engineering \\nin the School of Mathematics, Computer \\nScience & Engineering\\n\\nFind out more\\nwww.city.ac.uk/pgorwellbridge\\n\\n\\x0c ...begins with  \\n\\n local effort\\n\\nwww.city.ac.uk\\n\\n7\\n\\nMaking connections \\nand changing lives\\n\\nt\\nc\\na\\np\\nm\\n\\n \\n\\ni\\n \\nl\\na\\nb\\no\\nl\\ng\\nd\\nn\\na\\n \\nl\\na\\nc\\no\\nl\\n \\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\n \\n\\nw\\nh\\nc\\nr\\na\\ne\\ns\\ne\\nR\\n\\nResearch with real-life impact\\nIn the 2014 Research Excellence Framework), 75 per \\ncent of City\\xe2\\x80\\x99s submitted research was considered \\nworld-leading (4*) or internationally excellent (3*). \\n1,470 of City\\xe2\\x80\\x99s journal publications from academic \\nstaff were with an international co-author, \\naccounting for 42.8 per cent of all publications*.\\n\\nCity works to international levels of research  \\nexcellence and cultivates a worldwide network of \\nresearch partnerships.
