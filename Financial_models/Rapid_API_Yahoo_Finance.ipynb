It has to be. Manufacturing industries that dominated the economy decades ago - textiles, televisions, even automobiles, to a large degree - have moved overseas, where costs are lower. Yet the U.S. economy, prior to the pandemic, had expanded to record levels. And now, the U.S. Healthcare industry is mobilizing to improve COVID-19 testing, treatments and vaccines. Consider that U.S. GDP was approximately $1 trillion in 1930 but nearly $22 trillion at the end of 2019. That's growth of 22-times. Meanwhile, the U.S. population has grown less than 3-times during that time span, to 320 million from 120 million. The delta between GDP growth and population growth has been driven in large part by innovation. In addition, the value of listed corporations on U.S. stock exchanges at the end of 2020 was approximately $32 trillion, representing 41% of global equity market capitalization, while U.S. GDP represented only 25% of global GDP. The current low level of interest rates (the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond yield is 1.1%) and the relatively high level of the dollar both attest to the confidence that global investors have in the innovative U.S. economy.\"},{\"id\":\"ARGUS_29246_ThematicPortfolio_1614331865000\",\"title\":\"The Argus Millennial Generation Model Portfolio\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2021-02-26T09:31:05Z\",\"summary\":\"There are now more than 80 million Millennials, born between 1982 and 2000 and ranging in age from their early 20s to their late-30s.

This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 3.4% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0% (though the Fed has said it will allow inflation to run hot for a while before raising short-term interest rates). After this reading, we expect that GDP reports going forward should settle into a low- to mid-single-digits rate. But there is still work to be done. At $21.2 trillion, the U.S. economy at the end of 3Q was almost 3% below its pre-pandemic highs. Some segments of the economy are back to or above pre-pandemic highs.

In January, BlackRock CEO Lawrence Fink, who oversees approximately $7 trillion in assets, announced that his firm would be investing in companies that are making progress on sustainability. Mr. Fink's new focus follows rapid growth in sustainable assets in recent years. According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies had grown to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight years. There were almost 400 ESG strategies launched in the Morningstar investment universe in 2019, compared with around 160 launches in 2016.  The UN Principles for Responsible Investing -- to which Argus Research is a signatory -- now represents more than 1,750 signatories with assets of US $80 trillion, according to Barron's. As assets have flowed in, SRI investing has evolved over the past 40 years.  Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \\\"sustainable\\\" business practices across all businesses that can have an \\\"impact\\\" on global issues such as workers' rights, poverty, hunger and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a list of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \\\"sustainable impact\\\" on the environment, workplace and community.  These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We derived our list by identifying companies that are either BUY-rated or HOLD-rated by Argus analysts, and also score highly on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.  JUST ranks the Russell 1000 on these criteria against a scale of 1-100. Here are the companies in the Argus Universe that score highest on the scale.  All are rated BUY at Argus.\"},{\"id\":\"MS_0P000000GY_AnalystReport_1604528374000\",\"title\":\"Analyst Report: Apple Inc.\",\"provider\":\"Morningstar\",\"publishedOn\":\"2020-11-04T22:19:34Z\",\"summary\":\"Apple designs a wide variety of consumer electronic devices, including smartphones (iPhone), tablets (iPad), PCs (Mac), smartwatches (Apple Watch), and TV boxes (Apple TV), among others.

Bank stocks, industrials and other cyclical shares including small caps underperformed Monday morning, giving back some recent gains. Technology shares outperformed after another week of declines last week, and the Nasdaq looked to open higher by nearly 1%.</p> \\n<p>The equity market moves coincided with steadying government bond yields. Treasury yields pulled back, especially on the long end of the curve, and the benchmark 10-year yield hovered below 1.7%. Last week, the 10-year yield jumped to more than 1.7% to reach its highest level since January 2020 as concerns that the quickly recovering economy might generate a rapid rise in inflation lingered.

Some strategists said they believed these new leaders in the market had room to run as the recovery chugs along.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Our U.S. Regime Indicator has shifted to mid-cycle, a phase where inflation is typically strongest,\\\" Bank of America strategist Jill Carey Hall wrote in a note. \\\"In this phase, small caps and value have typically outperformed large caps and growth – further supported by the profits recovery and economic rebound we expect this year.\\\"</p> \\n<p>However, \\\"inflation-sensitive sectors such as energy and materials are still trading at big discounts to history across a variety of metrics we track, and the S&amp;P 500 overall is discounting a tepid inflation outlook,\\\" she added. \\\"Within small caps, cyclicals continue to trade at a significant discount to defensives, with inflation-sensitive small cap sectors like Energy broadly inexpensive both vs. history and vs. large cap peers.\\\"</p> \\n<p>—</p> \\n<h2>9:30 a.m. ET: Stocks mostly higher, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq gain</h2> \\n<p>Here's where markets were trading after the opening bell Monday morning:&nbsp;</p> \\n<ul> \\n <li><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>^GSPC</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: +6.17 points (+0.16%) to 3,919.27</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Dow (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EDJI?p=%5EDJI\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>^DJI</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: -49.96 points (-0.15%) to 32,578.01</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Nasdaq (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EIXIC?p=%5EIXIC\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>^IXIC</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: +81.21 (+0.61%) to 13,300.22</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Crude (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CL=F?p=CL=F\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>CL=F</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: +$0.18 (+0.29%) to $61.60 a barrel</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Gold (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F?p=GC=F\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>GC=F</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: -$11.10 (-0.64%) to $1,730.60 per ounce</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>10-year Treasury (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=%5ETNX\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>^TNX</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: -4.1 bps to yield 1.691%</p></li> \\n</ul> \\n<p>—</p> \\n<h2>7:05 a.m. ET Monday: Stock futures point to a mixed open</h2> \\n<p>Here's where markets were trading as of 7:05 a.m. ET Monday morning:</p> \\n<ul> \\n <li><p><strong>S&amp;P 500 futures (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ES=F?p=ES=F\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>ES=F</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: 3,901.75, up 2.25 points or 0.06%</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Dow futures (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/YM=F?p=YM=F\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>YM=F</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: 32,438.00, down 65 points or 0.2%</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Nasdaq futures (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NQ=F?p=NQ=F\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>NQ=F</strong></a><strong>):</strong> 12,942.75, up 98.25 points or 0.76%</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Crude (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/CL=F?p=CL=F\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>CL=F</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: +$0.24 (+0.39%) to $61.66 a barrel</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>Gold (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GC=F?p=GC=F\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>GC=F</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: -$10.30 (-0.59%) to $1,731.40 per ounce</p></li> \\n <li><p><strong>10-year Treasury (</strong><a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ETNX?p=%5ETNX\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>^TNX</strong></a><strong>)</strong>: -5.3 bps to yield 1.679%</p></li> \\n</ul> \\n<figure>\\n <img src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-03/c2ca8a10-8afb-11eb-b7ff-14ad27c8603e\\\" alt=\\\"People are seen on Wall St. outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 19, 2021.

January existing home sales were revised slightly down to 6.66 million from 6.69 million. The decline far outpaced the expected decrease of 2.8%, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.</p> \\n<p>“Despite the drop in home sales for February – which I would attribute to historically-low inventory – the market is still outperforming pre-pandemic levels,” said Lawrence Yun, NAR’s chief economist.</p> \\n<div></div> \\n<p>The number of homes for sale, otherwise known as inventory, fell to a record low of 1.03 million units, the same as in January. That was down 29.5% from one year ago. Typically you see an increase in inventory from January and February but that did not occur this year, according to Yun.</p> \\n<p>The median existing-home price in February was $313,000, up 15.8% from February 2020, as prices rose in every region. February’s national price jump marks 108 straight months of year-over-year gains.</p> \\n<p>“It’s quite a dramatic drop that that’s the reason why price is rising, demand is very strong and is reflected in days on the market,” Yun said during a press conference announcing the results.</p> \\n<p>Properties typically remained on the market for 20 days in February, down from 21 days in January and from 36 days in February 2020 — the swiftest pace since NAR started tracking. Seventy-four percent of the homes sold in February 2021 were on the market for less than a month.</p> \\n<p>“Even with this decline, sales would still be well above the pre-pandemic run rate,” Credit Suisse wrote in a note prior to the results. “Existing home sales have recently outperformed negative signals in the pending home sales data, which have declined 5.7% since August 2020, but we expect the two series to converge. Home builder sentiment, reflecting the housing market outlook from the supply side, has also declined slightly in recent months.”</p> \\n<p>Yun warned that \\\"in upcoming months demand may retreat\\\" a little as mortgage rates increase. The February resuls do not reflect the already rising rates, since all the sales represent deals that were signed in January before rates started inching up. Earlier this month this interest rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage <a href=\\\"https://money.yahoo.com/mortgage-rates-topped-3-for-the-first-time-since-july-175412310.html\\\"

Cuts Fees on $7.6 Billion Style ETFs to Near Zero\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-cuts-fees-7-6-123609879.html\",\"summary\":\"(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc.’s revamped $7.6 billion lineup of style ETFs will feature new benchmarks, different tickers and a perk: rock-bottom fees.The world’s biggest exchange-traded fund issuer is cutting the expense ratios on nine iShares Morningstar U.S. Equity Style Box ETFs to a range of 0.03% to 0.06%. That’s down from previous charges that varied between 0.25% and 0.30%. Those products -- which focus on specific approaches such as company size and growth or value investing -- are now tracking the Morningstar Broad Style Indexes that were launched in January.Fees have emerged as a battleground in the quickly growing $6 trillion ETF industry, where competition has prompted some of the biggest funds to slash costs to industry lows. BlackRock has been locked in a contest with runner-up Vanguard Group for flows, with the latter winning last year for the first time since 2013. Meanwhile, once-niche issuers such as Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management have jumped up the leaderboard as investors swarm to theme-friendly funds.The decision on cutting fees reflects BlackRock’s commitment to being the leading ETF provider in all segments of the industry, including the burgeoning thematics arena, according to the head of iShares Americas Armando Senra. Back in June, BlackRock lowered the expense ratio of its largest fund -- the $258 billion iShares Core S&P 500 ETF -- to 0.03% in order to match a rival product from Vanguard.“We wanted to be incredibly competitive in the market for that cost-conscious buyer,” Senra said in a phone interview.Prior to the fee cuts, BlackRock’s style ETFs were expensive relative to peers. The biggest of the collection, the $2.3 billion iShares Morningstar Growth ETF -- formerly known as the iShares Morningstar Large-Cap Growth ETF -- has an expense ratio of 0.04%, versus 0.25% previously. That brings the fund in line with the fee on the $68 billion Vanguard Growth ETF.In addition to the sweeping changes, the style funds have also undergone share splits of varying ratios. Senra said that model portfolios -- both BlackRock’s own and those created by outside firms -- are a key area of focus for the company. Many of these are built with small-account sizes, often under $10,000, said Chad Slawner, BlackRock’s head of iShares U.S. product.“Many of the firms that give us feedback want lower share prices to be able to build the models appropriately,” Slawner said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\"publisher\":\"Bloomberg\",\"author\":\"Katie Greifeld and Annie Massa\",\"type\":\"story\",\"entities\":[{\"term\":\"TICKER:BLK\",\"label\":\"BlackRock, Inc.\",\"score\":1.0},{\"term\":\"TICKER:MORN\",\"label\":\"Morningstar, Inc.\",\"score\":1.0}],\"offnet\":false,\"content\":\"<p>(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc.’s revamped $7.6 billion lineup of style ETFs will feature new benchmarks, different tickers and a perk: rock-bottom fees.</p>\\n<p>The world’s biggest exchange-traded fund issuer is cutting the expense ratios on nine iShares Morningstar U.S. Equity Style Box ETFs to a range of 0.03% to 0.06%.

(Image: Reuters/Eva Plevier)\\n </figcaption>\\n <div class=\\\"photo-credit\\\">\\n  Eva Plevier / reuters\\n </div>\\n</figure> \\n<p>The coronavirus pandemic has upended much of the world’s workforce, turning dining room tables, kitchen counters, and even closets into offices for millions of remote workers.</p> \\n<p>And while it hasn’t been an easy transition, especially for those with kids or less than ideal living situations, a new Microsoft (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT?p=MSFT&amp;.tsrc=fin-srch\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">MSFT</a>) survey shows the overwhelming majority of workers across the globe want at least some of the benefits of working from home to carry over to post-pandemic life.</p> \\n<p>According to Microsoft’s first-annual Work Trend Index, which surveyed 30,000 people from 31 countries, 73% of workers want their employers to continue providing flexible remote work options after the world returns to some semblance of normalcy.</p> \\n<p>“The data is clear. Extreme flexibility and hybrid work will define the post-pandemic workplace,” the survey notes. “Employees want control of where, when, and how they work, and expect businesses to provide options. The decisions business leaders make in the coming months to enable flexible work will impact everything from culture and innovation to how organizations attract and retain top talent.”</p> \\n<p>At the same time, the isolation caused by the pandemic and long-term work-from-home requirements has plenty of workers yearning to meet with their colleagues face to face.</p> \\n<p>The study found that 67% of workers want more in-person time with their coworkers. Of course, I’d take face-to-face time with my dentist at this point, so those numbers might come down as people go back out into the world again and the allure of in-person interaction fades.</p> \\n<h2>A shift in work culture is already happening</h2> \\n<p>The work from home shift has already pushed some companies to change their entire work culture. Twitter (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TWTR/\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">TWTR</a>), Square (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/SQ/\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">SQ</a>), and REI have all said they will allow their employees to work remotely permanently, while other firms, such as Microsoft, are offering workers the ability to take part in a hybrid work-from-home model, where employees go into the office a few days a week and continue working from home other days.</p> \\n<p>Not every company is on board with allowing employees to work from home on a permanent or semi-permanent basis, though. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon has been particularly outspoken about his distaste for seeing his employees working from home.</p> \\n<p>During Credit Suisse’s annual Virtual Financial Services Forum in February, Solomon called the <a href=\\\"https://news.yahoo.com/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-working-from-home-aberration-133534371.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">current work-from-home situation an “aberration” </a>that the company was “going to fix as fast as possible.” Still, Fox Business reported last week that <a href=\\\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/business-leaders/solomon-softens-on-bringing-people-back-to-work\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">Solomon may be softening his stance</a> on remote work, which would put him in line with other corporate decision makers.</p> \\n<p>Microsoft’s survey shows that 66% of corporate decision makers surveyed are thinking of redesigning their offices around a hybrid work-from-home model.</p> \\n<p>While employees may want the option of working remotely, being forced to do so as a result of the pandemic has had a deleterious impact on many workers. Fifty-five of respondents said they feel overworked, while 39% said they felt exhausted.</p> \\n<p>Based on anonymized data Microsoft collected via its Teams and Outlook apps, employees are also reaching out to colleagues less than when the pandemic started. From April 2020 through February 2021, Microsoft says the number of people chatting within large Teams channels decreased by 5%, while interactions between individuals and small groups increased 87%.</p> \\n<p>Microsoft is calling on companies to focus on team building and cut back on employees’ workload, though that might be unrealistic. Its survey results aren’t an anomaly. A recent PWC survey of 133 executives and 1,200 employees based in the <a href=\\\"https://www.pwc.com/us/en/library/covid-19/us-remote-work-survey.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">U.S. found that 55% of workers</a> would prefer to work from home at least 3 days a week. What’s more, 52% of employees and 34% of executives say they’re more productive working from home</p> \\n<p>The pandemic still isn’t over, and plenty of people will be working remotely for the foreseeable future. But if companies want to keep their employees happy, they’ll need to appeal to those who want to work remotely — and those who are eager to get back into the office.</p> \\n<p><a href=\\\"https://ad.doubleclick.net/ddm/trackclk/N360801.1913355YAHOOADMANAGER/B23770829.266706161;dc_trk_aid=461726082;dc_trk_cid=128183703;dc_lat=;dc_rdid=;tag_for_child_directed_treatment=;tfua=\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><strong>Sign up for Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter</strong></a></p> \\n<figure>\\n <img src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rPNJPDTPXku3B8afnW9Fgw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GqhuRmZKK6Ls8.RQHDK21g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/fNb4Su7Vzf9MrefeQTCo2Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ZVuzS87U4WJvSW15ZtzxLg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtjZj13ZWJw/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/xLBRbt07p3It4Tre71t6ag--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/OvUQInQDf3C.VVQA6RUbow--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/wP8IJt_jnwwlNYoYi1rcCQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/kJxSjeh6btkSGIV8XL11CQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8k2TCdmQYgFYzjWJcaj02A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTcwNQ--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Ti1jIg.cUeH.eUupjR2DEQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TDM26r.bw78Y9tvJn1GubQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/L.jberG.RuhnYEv.UVeT9Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/S9.NGsnhc6LuH6vspTv9oQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MA--/https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/feVndJXbz3olGMgHxxF07g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTI4NQ--/https://media-mbst-pub-ue1.s3.amazonaws.com/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-10/6e339530-0975-11eb-b5ff-7dcfae27b0e5\\\" data-uuid=\\\"\\\">\\n <figcaption></figcaption>\\n</figure> \\n<p><em>Got a tip?

\\n<p>\\\"There is <strong>always</strong> some reason or the other since the start of this bull market to complain/worry about,\\\" Bank of America strategists led by Ajay Kapur <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/three-pillars-of-bull-market-in-place-morning-brief-095329123.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">wrote last week</a> (emphasis ours). \\\"That's why bull markets climb a wall of worry.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Kapur and his team were discussing how quickly worries about inflation supplanted worries about COVID-19 and its economic impacts. This shift in worries was confirmed by <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bank-of-america-fund-manager-survey-for-march-2021-121053204.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">BofA's new monthly fund manager survey</a>, which showed inflation and concerns of a \\\"tantrum\\\" in the bond market ended COVID-19's 12-month streak as the \\\"biggest tail risk.\\\"</p> \\n<p>While there's no question the experience of the coronavirus pandemic has been unprecedented, <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/merrill-lynch-harris-nails-truth-about-risk-always-something-165237880.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">it is <strong>\\\"always\\\"</strong> the case</a> that there are top risks that stock market investors have to be worried about. Even in the best of times.</p> \\n<p>That's just how investing in stocks works: it's risky. And so investors demand a premium for taking on these risks, which is why returns for stocks are higher than returns for risk-free securities like Treasury securities.</p> \\n<p>COVID-19 was a massive risk event that came with high uncertainty, and the stock market crashed until it eventually got to a level where investors could see that the potential rewards justified the risk of buying equities. The fact that the S&amp;P 500 (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">^GSPC</a>) is <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-record-high-coronavirus-one-year-morning-brief-110109977.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">up nearly 80% since its March 2020 low</a> speaks to the kind of return investors are rewarded with when things are particularly bleak.</p> \\n<p>Now, just because a concern becomes a top risk doesn't mean that that risk will be as damaging as any other top risk. As Kapur and his team argued, despite inflation becoming a top risk, the <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/three-pillars-of-bull-market-in-place-morning-brief-095329123.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">\\\"pillars\\\" of the bull market remain</a>.</p> \\n<p>This sentiment is shared by BofA's peers at RBC Capital Markets. A recent survey asked the RBC's analysts what kept them up at night.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Our analysts exhibited some concern about inflation,\\\" RBC's Lori Calvasina wrote. \\\"Importantly, despite this evidence of inflation angst, most of our analysts still have a positive outlook for performance, margins, and fundamentals... To dig in a little deeper on the inflation debate, we also asked our analysts to give us their thoughts on how reflation – the broader topic of economic reopening – impacted their industries from a fundamental perspective. Overall, 86% said reflation/economic reopening is positive or very positive for their industries.\\\"</p> \\n<p>The takeaway here is that <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-list-of-risks-unkown-terrifying-morning-brief-110004760.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">some risks are more problematic</a> than others. And as Morning Brief highlighted in its <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2010s-stock-market-chart-of-the-decade-morning-brief-110726020.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">Chart of the Decade</a>, there will always be a \\\"biggest risk\\\" on the top of investors' minds. And historically, the stock market has found a way to recover any losses that come with the rise of these risks.</p> \\n<p><em>By </em><a href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/sam-ro\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\"><em>Sam Ro</em></a><em>, managing editor.

Exits Apollo Ahead of Schedule and Cedes Chairman Role\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leon-black-steps-down-apollo-113045518.html\",\"summary\":\"(Bloomberg) -- Leon Black, the Wall Street billionaire who appeared to be a main client of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, is stepping down as chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management Inc. months ahead of schedule.Black’s departure from that role had been announced in January, though the firm said at the time that he would leave by July 1. A statement Monday confirmed his immediate exit from the position as well as the chairmanship he’d been expected to keep.Co-founder Marc Rowan has taken over as CEO, Jay Clayton was named non-executive chairman, and Apollo added two more independent directors to its board, according to the statement.It’s an abrupt turn for Black, 69, a Wall Street legend who built Apollo into one of the most fearsome -- and profitable -- names in American finance. He cited unspecified health issues for himself and his wife in announcing his exit.“Marc has seamlessly transitioned into the CEO role and I am confident Apollo will soar to new heights under his leadership,” Black said in the statement.Black and Apollo have been dealing with the fallout from his extensive links with convicted sex offender Epstein, which brought unprecedented scrutiny and unsettled clients and shareholders.After new evidence of Black’s ties to the late financier surfaced last year, Apollo hired a law firm to look into the matter. The investigation found that Black paid Epstein $158 million between 2012 and 2017 -- after Epstein pleaded guilty to felony charges in 2008. Apollo has long maintained it never hired Epstein for any services, and Black was never accused of any involvement in his criminal activities.Apollo expects to report earnings that exceed analysts’ estimates and first-quarter fundraising that’s “trending toward the high end” of the firm’s annual range of $15 billion to $20 billion, Black said in the statement.Shares of New York-based Apollo climbed 1% to $47.76 at 9:30 a.m. in New York, paring this year’s decline to 2.5%.The appointments of two additional directors, Richard Emerson and Kerry Murphy Healey, brings Apollo’s board to 15 members, two-thirds of them independent.

That day, during a conference call with analysts, Black was conspicuously absent. The Rowan era had already begun.Rowan, 58, was considered somewhat of an underdog. While he was the mastermind behind some of Apollo’s most profitable wagers, including Athene, he was often in the background. He’s considered more staid than fellow co-founder Josh Harris, who was seen as having a closer relationship with Black and deemed to be a more likely successor.Throughout his career, Black earned a reputation for overcoming disasters.He founded Apollo in 1990 with partners from Drexel Burnham Lambert, the junk-bond shop led by Michael Milken that collapsed in a scandal. Following the 2008 financial crisis, Apollo came up with ways to protect its investments even when some of the companies it backed failed.See also: Apollo Investors Are Left Waiting for Results of Epstein ProbeBut Black’s ties with Epstein brought unprecedented scrutiny upon the firm, unsettling clients and shareholders. Some public pension plans halted their commitments, threatening fundraising.Now is “the ideal moment to step back and focus on my family, my wife Debra’s and my health issues, and my many other interests,” Black said Monday. “I intend to remain Apollo’s largest shareholder, and strongest supporter.”(Updates with new directors starting in third paragraph, share price in ninth, Athene deal in 10th, Josh Harris in 11th.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\"publisher\":\"Bloomberg\",\"author\":\"Sabrina Willmer\",\"type\":\"story\",\"entities\":[{\"term\":\"TICKER:APO-PA\",\"label\":\"Apollo Global Management, Inc. \",\"score\":1.0}],\"offnet\":false,\"content\":\"<p>(Bloomberg) -- Leon Black, the Wall Street billionaire who appeared to be a main client of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, is stepping down as chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management Inc. months ahead of schedule.</p>\\n<p>Black’s departure from that role had been announced in January, though the firm said at the time that he would leave by July 1.

The push came as Walmart ended initiatives to use Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc drivers, and struggled with using its own employees, to deliver packages. </p> \\n<p> On Feb. 26, DoorDash surveyed its more than 1 million independent drivers, asking them to share \\\"experiences\\\" about deliveries for Walmart. \\\"We heard your feedback. Make Walmart orders better,\\\" the survey says, according to a version Reuters has seen that DoorDash confirmed as authentic. </p> \\n<p> As DoorDash expands beyond its urban restaurant&nbsp;roots&nbsp;to the&nbsp;delivery of everything&nbsp;- from groceries to gardening tools -&nbsp;across&nbsp;the country, it has run into etiquette issues. Americans who are used to tipping for burgers or burritos do not always think to tip for delivery of household goods or pet food. After all, they do not tip for postal, UPS or Amazon deliveries. </p> \\n<p> CEO Doug McMillon last month said delivery is key to its Walmart+ subscription program, launched in September. The program, which costs $98 a year, offers unlimited grocery and merchandise delivery on orders over $35 from Walmart stores. </p> \\n<p> \\\"Logistics and delivery will continue to be a bit of a pain point for Walmart because they view it as a place where they could potentially reduce costs,\\\" said Chad Oviatt, director of investment at Walmart shareholder Huntington Private Bank. </p> \\n<p> Partnering with Walmart has helped DoorDash take market share from rivals including Grubhub Inc and tap into new pockets of demand for delivery in suburban areas, where many Walmart stores are located. </p> \\n<p> But some DoorDash drivers complain of heavy loads and long waits for picking up parcels at stores. Customer tips are another sore point, especially for drivers who are used to getting bigger tips on restaurant orders, several people said. </p> \\n<p> After her day job, DoorDash driver Kat Ensey, 53, makes money delivering sandwiches and sodas outside of Chicago. Bringing Walmart orders to shoppers' homes is less profitable, she said. Ensey, standing 5 feet-2-inches tall, recalled once hauling 13, 30-pound bags of soil from her car through a muddy yard to a Walmart customer's back patio. DoorDash paid her $4 for the delivery. The customer did not tip. </p> \\n<p> Until last fall, Walmart's app, which takes customers' delivery orders, did not allow shoppers to include tips up front. Instacart Inc - a third-party service that handles deliveries for Kroger Co and other grocers - includes a pre-delivery tip of $2, and Amazon.com Inc's Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh include a $7 tip. Customers can then change the amounts. </p> \\n<p> DoorDash said it approached Walmart last year about allowing customers to add a tip to their order before they finalize a purchase. A spokeswoman for Walmart said this was \\\"a great idea\\\" and changed its app in October to allow online shoppers to tip before they pay for their order. </p> \\n<p> Since that move, she said, 75% of Walmart shoppers allocate tips. But the DoorDash spokeswoman said the company did not finish updating its own app until late February, so drivers could not see tips before deciding to accept a delivery. </p> \\n<p> 'CHANGES ON THE HORIZON' </p> \\n<p> While DoorDash regularly checks in with its drivers about various issues, its February survey focused entirely on Walmart, asking recipients to score how likely they are to recommend delivery of Walmart goods to other drivers. </p> \\n<p> The document also promised \\\"there are more changes on the horizon\\\" pertaining to its relationship with Walmart, though it did not specify what those are. DoorDash declined to provide the survey results to Reuters or elaborate on future changes. </p> \\n<p> DoorDash said it charges different prices based on distance, time and which services its merchants need. Spokeswomen for Walmart and DoorDash declined to disclose financial terms of the companies' agreement. </p> \\n<p> Walmart said it has taken several measures to speed online orders for pickup and delivery, including raising the number of personal shoppers in stores to more than 170,000 from over 63,000 in November 2019, a move that could help reduce how long drivers wait for parcels. </p> \\n<p> Walmart is also adding small robot-staffed warehouses to dozens of its stores to help fill orders faster, the company said in January. </p> \\n<p> Some Walmart workers also \\\"regularly\\\" drive for third-party delivery companies so they can report back to Walmart on their experience. </p> \\n<p> DoorDash driver Brian Cavanaugh, 48, said he is happy to take all orders, including Walmart's, when he is delivering outside of Cleveland. After one recent Walmart order, a customer tipped him $40. </p> \\n<p> \\\"If I see a Walmart order, I immediately within seconds am pushing that button to accept,\\\" he said. \\\"The Walmart

It last changed hands at 8.0749. </p> \\n<p> \\\"The lira is being smashed by investors fearing that the custodian of its value does not share their hopes for a stable currency underpinned by positive real interest rates,\\\" said Westpac senior currency strategist Sean Callow, adding that the lira may not yet have found a bottom. </p> \\n<p> \\\"The real test will be when the volume comes in in Europe,\\\" he said. </p> \\n<p> Goldman Sachs and others had expected a sharp dive in the lira and Turkish assets given the new governor's dovish and even unorthodox views, and what was seen as the latest damage to the bank's credibility amid years of policy interference that has dogged the major emerging market economy. </p> \\n<p> The weekend overhaul could soon reverse the hawkish steps taken by predecessor Naci Agbal, analysts said, and nudge Turkey toward a balance of payments crisis given its depleted buffer of FX reserves. </p> \\n<p> One possible scenario would see the lira swing as much as 15% in both directions in Monday's European session as \\\"TRY sets off on a roller-coaster ride driven by capital flight, central bank interventions and bargain hunters,\\\" SEB Research wrote in a client note. </p> \\n<p> Erdogan fired Agbal two days after a sharp rate hike that was meant to head off inflation of nearly 16% and a dipping lira. </p> \\n<p> In less than five months on the job, Agbal had raised rates by 875 basis points to 19% and regained some policy credibility as the lira rallied from its nadir. But the currency gave back most of those gains in less than 10 minutes as the week's trade began. </p> \\n<p> \\\"It is going to be a dark and long day on Monday,\\\" said one Turkish fund manager. </p> \\n<p> Cristian Maggio, a strategist at TD Securities, predicted a 10%-15% lira depreciation over the coming days. </p> \\n<p> The overhaul \\\"demonstrates the erratic nature of policy decisions in Turkey, especially with regard to monetary matters (and risks) looser, unorthodox, and eventually mostly pro-growth policies from now on,\\\" he said. </p> \\n<p> On the call with Turkish bankers, Kavcioglu said any policy change would depend on lowering inflation, which he said was the primary goal, the source familiar with the call said. </p> \\n<p> Kavcioglu said the current policy approach would continue, the source added. The central bank did not immediately comment. </p> \\n<p> In a statement on Sunday, Kavcioglu said the bank would focus on permanently lowering inflation, which has been stuck in double digits for most of the last four years. </p> \\n<p> A former member of parliament for Erdogan's AK Party (AKP), Kavcioglu has espoused the unorthodox views shared by the president. He wrote high rates \\\"indirectly cause inflation to rise,\\\" in a newspaper column last month. </p> \\n<p> WEEKEND OF QUESTIONS </p> \\n<p> Agbal's latest rate hike was 200 basis-points on Thursday which sparked a more than 3% lira rally. </p> \\n<p> His hawkish stance dramatically cut Turkey's CDS risk gauges and started to reverse a years-long trend of funds abandoning local assets. </p> \\n<p> But after Erdogan ousted Agbal, investors told Reuters they had worked through the weekend to predict how quickly and sharply Kavcioglu might cut rates - and how much the currency would retreat. </p> \\n<p> The heads of some local treasury desks had estimated offers up to 8.00 on Monday. At Istanbul's Grand Bazaar on Saturday, one trader said a dollar bought 7.80-7.90 of the local currency. </p> \\n<p> Wall Street bank Goldman told clients it was reviewing investment recommendations and predicted a \\\"discontinuous\\\" drop in the lira, and a \\\"front-loaded\\\" rate-cutting cycle. </p> \\n<p> The overhaul meant capital outflows appeared likely and a rapid adjustment in the current account may be necessary since markets would shy away from funding Turkey's chronic deficits, it said. </p> \\n<p> Concerns over central bank independence have exacerbated Turkey's boom-and-bust economy and record dollarisation, and prompted last year's unorthodox and costly policy of FX interventions, economists say. </p> \\n<p> The lira has lost half its value since a 2018 currency crisis. </p> \\n<p> Kavcioglu said in the statement that policy meetings will remain on a monthly schedule, suggesting any rate cuts may wait until the next planned meeting on April 15. </p>

The question now is whether the findings will help rebuild public confidence in the vaccine around the world, as the company seeks to win clearance in the United States</p> \\n<p>In a statement, AstraZeneca said its COVID-19 vaccine was 79% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and was 100% effective in stopping severe disease and hospitalization, though it has not yet published full data so it's unclear if there were enough severe cases to make that finding significant. Investigators said the vaccine worked across adults of all ages, including older people — something experts wanted better data on.</p> \\n<p>AstraZeneca’s interim results are based on 141 COVID-19 cases, but officials declined to tell reporters during a news conference Monday how many were in study volunteers who received the vaccine and how many in those who received dummy shots. </p> \\n<p>“These findings reconfirm previous results observed,” said Ann Falsey, of the University of Rochester School of Medicine, who helped lead the trial. “It’s exciting to see similar efficacy results in people over 65 for the first time.”</p> \\n<p>AstraZeneca will apply for authorization for use of the vaccine in the United States from the Food and Drug Administration in the first half of April, Ruud Dobber, a company executive vice president, told reporters Monday. An FDA advisory committee will publicly debate the evidence behind the shots before the agency decides whether to allow emergency use. Dobber said that, if the FDA OK’s the vaccine, the company will deliver 30 million doses immediately — and another 20 within the first month. </p> \\n<p>The AstraZeneca shot, which has been authorized in more than 70 countries, is a pillar of a U.N.-backed project known as COVAX that aims to get COVID-19 vaccines to poorer countries, and it has also become a key tool in European countries’ efforts to boost their sluggish vaccine rollouts. But <a href=\\\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-pause-astrazeneca-doubt-elsewhere-3ae7c1aca20f36c03cacbe7c3f23d1a7\\\">confidence in the shot has taken repeated hits</a> because of concerns about how data was reported from some previous trials, confusion over its efficacy in older adults and a recent scare over clotting.</p> \\n<p>Stephen Evans, of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, said the new data could help to allay concerns about the vaccine.</p> \\n<p>“The benefits of these results will mainly be for the rest of the world where confidence in the AZ (AstraZeneca) vaccine has been eroded, largely by political and media comment,” he said.</p> \\n<p>The study comprised more than 30,000 volunteers, of whom two-thirds were given the vaccine while the rest got dummy shots. Two doses were given to people four weeks apart. </p> \\n<p>Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the results were reassuring but that more details were needed to back up AstraZeneca's claim that the vaccine was completely effective at preventing severe disease and hospitalization.</p> \\n<p>”It would be good to know how many severe cases occurred in the control group and so what the confidence intervals are for this 100% figure,\\\" said Hunter, who was not connected to the study. “But this should add confidence that the vaccine is doing what it is most needed for.” </p> \\n<p>Scientists had hoped the U.S. study would clear up some of the confusion about just how well the shots really work, particularly in older people. Previous research suggested the vaccine was effective in younger populations, but there was no solid data proving its efficacy in those over 65, often those most vulnerable to COVID-19.</p> \\n<p>Britain first authorized the vaccine based on partial results from testing in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa that suggested the shots were about 70% effective. But those results were clouded by a manufacturing mistake that led some participants to get just a half dose in their first shot — an error the researchers didn’t immediately acknowledge.</p> \\n<p>Then came more questions, about <a href=\\\"https://apnews.com/article/eu-authorizes-astrazeneca-vaccine-adults-18b545dd51ea56f422ff28cdeb2dd08b\\\">how well the vaccine protected older adults</a> and how long to wait before the second dose. Some European countries including Germany, France and Belgium initially withheld the shot from older adults and only reversed their decisions after new data suggested it was offering seniors protection.</p> \\n<p>AstraZeneca’s vaccine development was rocky in the U.S., too. Last fall, the FDA suspended the company’s study for an unusual six weeks, as frustrated regulators sought information about some neurologic complaints reported in Britain; ultimately, there was no evidence the vaccine was to blame.</p> \\n<p>Last week, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, temporarily suspended their use of the AstraZeneca shot after reports it was linked to rare blood clots — even as international health agencies insisted the benefits of the vaccine outweighed the risks. On Thursday, the European Medicines Agency concluded after an investigation that the vaccine did not raise the overall risk of blood clots, but could not rule out that it was connected to two very rare types of clots. It recommended adding a warning about these cases to the vaccine's leaflet.</p> \\n<p>It's not unheard of for such rare problems to crop up as vaccines are rolled out since trials typically look at tens of thousands of people, and some issues are only seen once the shot is used in millions of people. </p> \\n<p>France, Germany, Italy and other countries subsequently <a href=\\\"https://apnews.com/article/europe-health-germany-coronavirus-pandemic-08d5b84cdd1ceddf1557f68f61332c26\\\">resumed their use of the shot</a> on Friday, with senior politicians rolling up their sleeves to show the vaccine was safe. </p> \\n<p>AstraZeneca said it would continue to analyze the U.S. data before submitting it to the FDA in the coming weeks. It said the data would also soon be published in a peer-reviewed journal. </p> \\n<p>The AstraZeneca shot is what scientists call a “viral vector” vaccine. The shots are made with a harmless virus, a cold virus that normally infects chimpanzees. It acts like a Trojan horse to carry the coronavirus's spike protein’s genetic material into the body that in turn produces some harmless protein. That primes the immune system to fight if the real virus comes along.</p> \\n<p>Two other companies, Johnson &amp; Johnson and China’s CanSino Biologics, make COVID-19 vaccines using the same technology but using different cold viruses.</p> \\n<p>___</p> \\n<p>Neergaard reported from Washington. </p> \\n<p>___</p> \\n<p>Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at <a

The stock is currently at about 223 euros. </p> \\n<p> Valuation comparisons are also supportive. </p> \\n<p> At 160 times forward earnings, Tesla is by far the most expensive stock in the autos sector, whereas Volkswagen and BMW still trade at only around 9-10 times forward earnings. </p> \\n<p> \\\"European carmakers, from a size and balance sheet perspective are well positioned to re-orient themselves towards electrification and they have strong distribution platforms,\\\" said Sunil Krishnan, head of multi-asset funds at Aviva Investors. </p> \\n<p> What's more, Volkswagen is also considering listing luxury car arm Porsche AG to help raise funds for investments in software and electric vehicles, according to a source. </p> \\n<p> STILL A VALUE PLAY </p> \\n<p> Despite its recent gains, Volkswagen's market value is still only about a quarter of Tesla's, and several analysts see further room for gains at both the German group and across the European autos industry. </p> \\n<p> \\\"Abandoned by all, and in particular by investors, the German auto industry, after eating a lot of dust and falling in a state of disrepair, understands that adherence to electrics must be total,\\\" Fugnoli said. </p> \\n<p> As well as lifting German autos stocks, the electrification drive is helping to boost broader European equity markets, which have long underperformed those in the United States. </p> \\n<p> Germany's DAX has been setting new record highs in March. </p> \\n<p> With positioning and flows into European equities still relatively weak, some investors think that could soon change. BofA's weekly flow data for March 10-17 showed fund managers withdrew $1 billion from Europe, while pumping a record $53 billion into U.S. equities. </p> \\n<p> Still, few think European indexes will attract the frenzied buying seen by tech stocks on the U.S. Nasdaq in recent years. </p> \\n<p> \\\"In Europe, it will remain a stock specific issue for a while, we won't be looking at the Euro50 this year as a tech index,\\\" Aviva's Kirshnan said. </p> \\n<p> \\\"But these things can change quickly - look how quickly VW moved up in the market cap pecking order.\\\" </p> \\n<p> (Reporting by Danilo Masoni and Thyagaraju Adinarayan.

Funds Capitulate on Dollar Short Bets as Losses Mount\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hedge-funds-turn-bullish-dollar-034126444.html\",\"summary\":\"(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds have capitulated on their short-dollar bets after surging Treasury yields upended a favorite global macro strategy.Leveraged funds flipped to become net buyers of the world’s reserve currency during the week to March 16 -- a tumultuous period that saw Treasury yields breaching key levels on feverish inflation fears. They added bearish bets on the yen and euro, and switched from bullish positions on the New Zealand dollar, data from Commodity Futures Trading Commission show.An intensifying debate over the pace of inflation gains has split investors, with some seeing Treasury yields soaring to 2% amid a global recovery spurred by vaccine rollouts and stimulus spending. That in turn is trouncing one of Wall Street’s most popular macro calls of 2021.The great unwind may just be gaining traction, some strategists said.“It is the bond market that has been driving the U.S. dollar in the past couple of months, and it appears to be intensifying,” said Alvin T. Tan, head of Asia foreign-exchange strategy at RBC Capital Markets. “I would expect further short-covering versus the U.S. dollar.”Holding dollar shorts would have served traders a 1.8% loss this year after being a profitable strategy in eight of the nine months through to December, Bloomberg data shows.Dollar buying by hedge funds rose to the most since August 2014, according to an analysis by Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. strategists including Khoon Goh. “With U.S. 10-year bond yields poised to rise further, expect financial market volatility to increase,” he said.Hedge funds’ long dollar positions climbed to 2,414 contracts, compared with shorts of 62,781 a week earlier, according to CFTC data on seven major currencies aggregated by Bloomberg. It is the first time they are bullish on the greenback since November.The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rose Monday before trading little changed, after the Turkish lira’s plunge spurred demand for haven assets. Meanwhile, there were signs that commodity-linked currencies were losing momentum.The Australian dollar, one of the year’s best performers to date, led G-10 losses to fall as much as 0.7%, its lowest level in nearly two weeks.

Stocks Top Analysts Are Heavily Bullish On Heading Into April\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-stocks-top-analysts-heavily-101955749.html\",\"summary\":\"Despite inflation fears as the economy reopens after a wider COVID-19 vaccination rollout, there are stocks that analysts are highly bullish on. Here’s a list of best-performing Wall Street analysts’ top five stocks with “Buy” ratings, as compiled by TipRanks. Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN): Baird analyst Colin Sebastian has reiterated a “Buy” rating and has a $4,000 price target in addition to a “Fresh Pick” status on the e-commerce giant. Colin has support from 30 other top analysts who have a “Buy” rating as well, as per TipRanks. Sebastian noted that investors could be missing \\\"one of the most compelling subscription/quasi-subscription models within the Internet and Technology sectors,” adding that 75% of Amazon’s revenue is recurring even as it keeps adding new subscribers effectively. Baird sees Amazon as \\\"significantly undervalued\\\" and can see it headed to $5,000 per share in the medium-term. See Also: Will Amazon Stock Reach ,000 By 2022? With a 75% success rate and 34.8% average return per rating, Sebastian is ranked 28 out of over 7,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT): Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a “Buy” rating and a $300 price target on the stock as he sees cloud growth momentum building up for the company. The rest of the Wall Street analysts are bullish as well with a total of 23 “Buy” ratings on the stock. Ives estimates that cloud wars between Amazon and Microsoft to capture market share are going to intensify and global cloud spending could reach nearly $1 trillion over the next decade. The veteran analyst has predicted a shift in tide in the cloud space, with Microsoft standing to benefit. See also: How To Buy Microsoft Stock Alphatec Holdings (NASDAQ: ATEC): Medical technology company focused on spinal surgeries has six “Buy” ratings from top analysts and a $19.7 average stock price forecast. H.C. Wainwright analyst Sean Lee, who claims a 75% success rate and 69.2% average return per rating, has maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock and raised the price target to $19 from $16. Lee’s rating comes after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue registered a 36% year-over-year surge despite the ongoing COVID-19 headwinds. The analyst expects EOS imaging to be a key growth driver for the company, contributing about $127 million in additional revenues by 2025. Alphatec's recently-launched procedure for lateral surgeries that significantly shortens the surgery times could also be a major growth driver this year. Addus Homecare Corp (NASDAQ: ADUS): Brokerage RBC Capital analyst Frank Morgan, who has a 5-star rating on the stock, has reiterated a \\\"Buy\\\" rating and a price target of $136. The Texas-based home and healthcare company recently unveiled a new value plan to support closer coordination of care for patients as they are discharged from acute care hospitals into their homes or into post-acute facilities. Morgan believes the plan “positions Addus for a larger role in post-acute coordination with potential for longer-term shared savings.” The analyst is also encouraged by the recently passed COVID federal relief aid as “it provides a 10% boost to the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage meant to bolster personal care services amid the pandemic.” This increase gives a larger match than Morgan originally expected, with earlier versions of the bill mentioning a 7.35% rise. Amyris Inc (NASDAQ: AMRS): H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal is bullish on the stock and has significantly roasted its price target to $35 from $11 and reiterated the “Buy” rating as well. Dayal, who has a 77% average per rating, along with three top analysts, has a similar view on the stock in the last two months. The average analyst price target comes in at $25.50. Dayal sees improving business fundamentals that support the company’s annual revenue growth outlook expectations of between 30% and 50% over the next few years. Also, its debt is set to land below $100 million by the end of the third quarter this year from $297 million at the beginning of 2020. The brokerage says the company currently has 18 ingredients currently in development that could position the company to have more than 30 commercialized ingredients by the end of 2025. In addition, it has four new brand launches in 2021, is expanding its retail presence, and could benefit from acquisitions and distribution agreements in international markets including China and Brazil. Based on all of the above, the analyst argues that revenues will grow at a nine-year CAGR from 2021 to 2030 of 28.8%, versus the previous 20.4% estimate.

getting more credit for its battery-powered car strategy that could lead the company to surpass Tesla Inc. in electric-vehicle sales as soon as next year, according to Deutsche Bank.If the market were to apply multiples similar to Tesla and Nio Inc. to VW’s battery-electric vehicle business, it would be worth about 195 billion euros ($230 billion), more than all of the company is worth now, analysts led by Tim Rokossa wrote in a report Monday. They lifted their price target for VW shares by 46% to 270 euros.VW’s common stock surged as much as 14% and its preference shares rose as much as 8.4% in Frankfurt, while its American depositary receipts climbed in New York.

Monster Growth Stocks With Potential for Further Gains\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-monster-growth-stocks-potential-185827558.html\",\"summary\":\"At the end of the day, investors want to see returns. To accomplish this goal, seasoned Wall Street observers often turn to one strategy time and time again: growth investing. A solid growth play is a name that appears poised to not only grow at an above-average rate but also reward investors handsomely over the long run. Rolling up their sleeves, investors are pounding the Wall Street pavement in search of the tickers with impressive long-term growth prospects. However, having a target in mind is one thing, but zeroing in on these stocks primed for gains in the coming years is another story entirely. With this in mind, we suited up and set out on our own hunt for the investment opportunities with strong growth narratives. Using TipRanks' Database, we were able to pinpoint 3 Buy-rated tickers that each boast considerable upside potential, according to Wall Street’s analysts. Cowen Group (COWN) We’ll start with Cowen Group, a New York-based investment bank. Cowen offers services in investment management and broker-dealing, and is known as a risk taker willing to move early into disruptive sectors; Cowen was an early booster of high-tech dot.com stocks, and more recently in the cannabis sector. The bank’s main operations are in the US and the UK. The bank’s recent share growth has been extreme; since this time last year, COWN shares are up 534%. The share appreciation has pushed the company’s market cap over $1 billion, and brought investors solid returns during the difficult corona crisis. After a turndown in 1Q20, the company showed three consecutive quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue and earnings gains. Those gains were particularly impressive in Q2 and Q4; looking at 4Q20, the most recent reported, Cowen posted a record quarterly net income of $90.5 million, by GAAP measures; full-year income was $209.6 million. The gains were driven by record performance in both the investment banking and the brokerage divisions. Cowen’s performance has impressed 5-star analyst Sumeet Mody, of Piper Sandler, who writes: “We remain very positive on COWN following the strong results of 4Q20 earnings. After the firm's sustained and elevated brokerage and banking activity throughout 2020, the outlook for earnings has meaningfully improved as banking pipelines remain robust and brokerage activity has started the year strong... The beat was broad based across the business lines, but largely driven by higher-than-expected investment banking and brokerage revenues as well as lower expense ratios.” To this end, Mody rates Cowen shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $71 price target suggests room for a 78% one-year upside from current levels. (To watch Mody’s track record, click here) The Piper Sandler analyst is the bullish outlier here, but Wall Street, for the most part, agrees with him on Cowen, as shown by the 3 to 1 split favoring Buy to Hold reviews. Shares are priced at $39.86 and their $47 average price target implies an upside of ~18% for the coming year. (See COWN stock analysis on TipRanks) Commercial Vehicle Group (CVGI) Talk about the automotive industry, and you’ll naturally start talking about the car companies. But the industry is more than that – there is a whole network of part suppliers and service companies that support the automakers, and Commercial Vehicle Group lives in that niche. The company supplies a variety services to the automotive sector, including warehouse automation, robotic assemblies, seating systems, plastic products, EV assemblies, and mechanical assemblies. Commercial Vehicle Group’s customer base includes the commercial truck industry, electric vehicle makers, and the ecommerce warehousing industry. The big story here, for CVG, has been the company’s warehouse automation segment. The corona crisis inspired a massive push toward ecommerce, and CVG has been a beneficiary of that move. The company’s warehouse automation segment saw higher volume in 2020 – and greater efficiency due to cost reduction actions during the year. Q4 revenues topped $216 million, a gain of 14% year-over-year. Operating income for the quarter was $5 million, a gain of $9.3 million year-over-year. The quarterly results marked the first year-over-year quarterly gains for the company in 2020, and come in after the company’s shares have consistently outperformed during the year. Shares in CVGI are up 543% in the last 12 months – far outpacing the broader markets. In a move that bodes well for the future, CVG announced at the beginning of this month a partnership with Xos, a commercial EV manufacturer, for the development of sustainability initiatives. Covering this stock for Barrington, 5-star analyst Christopher Howe was impressed by the company’s backlog of new business. “The company achieved net new business wins of more than $100 million annualized in 2020, primarily driven by warehouse automation and electric vehicles, all of which is expected to convert this year. Moving forward, it expects to achieve another $100 million of net new business wins in 2021,” Howe noted. The analyst added “[EV] activity is robust [and] the company anticipates these programs to remain in the development phase through 2021, later converting into revenue once product baselines have stabilized. In regard to warehouse automation, according to Logistics IQ, demand for warehouse automation products is expected to grow approximately 14% per year through 2026.” In light of these comments, Howe rates CVGI shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $14 price target to indicate a one-year upside of 39%. (To watch Howe’s track record, click here) There are two analyst reviews on file for this company, and they both agree: CVGI is a stock to buy. The shares have an average price target of $14, matching Howe’s. (See CVGI stock analysis on TipRanks) Zedge, Inc. (ZDGE) We’ll wrap up our look at growth stocks with a denizen of the software industry, Zedge. This company offers customization options for smartphones, which have proven to be highly popular. Zedge’s platform offers wallpapers, ringtones, app icons, widgets, and notification sounds, among other features. The Zedge app boasts over 450 million installs, and more than 30 million monthly active users – key metrics in the smartphone app universe. But perhaps the most telling statistic is this: Zedge has consistently been in the top 25 free apps on Google Play for the past seven years. That kind of popularity gives a software company a solid foundation, and Zedge’s shares have reaped the benefits. The stock is up an astounding 932% in just the past 6 months, growth that has coincided with growing revenues. Zedge has seen 5 quarters in a row of year-over-year top line growth. The company reported its fiscal 2Q21 results on March 15, and the results were record-breaking for the company. Revenue came in at $5.3 million, net income at $2.3 million, and EPS at 17 cents. Monthly active users hit 35.4 million. The revenue number represented a 101% gain year-over-year; the EPS was up from just 1 cent in the prior year. After these gangbuster results, Zedge revised its full-year 2021 revenue guidance upward to a prediction of 75% to 80% growth. Analyst Allen Klee, of Maxim Group, is impressed with Zedge, and sees a clear path forward for the company. “Zedge is accelerating growth from its advertising platform and new offerings. We expect the company to strengthen its ecosystem so that the 35M monthly active users will be more engaged in the platform resulting in better retention and monetization. We also expect 2021 to have catalysts from growing the short-form story telling of Shortz and new entertainment-like podcasts,” Klee opined. Based on all of the above, Klee puts a Buy rating on ZDGE shares, along with a $24 price target. This target conveys Klee's confidence in Zedge's ability to climb 57% higher in the next twelve months. Some stocks fly under the radar, and ZDGE is one of those. Zedge's is the only recent analyst review of this company, and it is decidedly positive.

Heats Up China EV Competition As It Begins Deliveries Of ID.4 Crozz SUV\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-heats-china-ev-competition-055228302.html\",\"summary\":\"A joint venture between Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) and China’s state-owned First Automobile Works delivered its first electric sports utility vehicle — the SUV ID.4 Crozz — to 12 customers over the weekend in Shenzhen. What Happened: The SUV, available in five models, ranges in price between RMB 199,000 ($30,720) to RMB 279,900 ($43,000) after subsidies and has a range of between 400 KM (248 Miles) to 550 KM (342 Miles), CnEVPost reported. The SUV is built on Volkswagen’s $7 billion modular MEB platform and is considered the first truly competitive vehicle for the Chinese market for the joint venture, as per CnEVPost. The MEB plant of the JV — located in Foshan, Guangdong province — currently produces in excess of 600,000 units and is expected to make 770,000 units by 2024. Why It Matters: Volkswagen OTC shares have soared 68.2% since the year began and rose 29.25% higher last Wednesday alone after the company revealed its technology roadmap for batteries and charging up to 2030. Wuling Motors — a joint venture between General Motors Compay (NYSE: GM) and state-owned SAIC Motor — has also found success with its Hong Guang Mini EV, which sells for $4,500 in China. The two-door car outsold Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3 last month. The sedan made by the Elon Musk-led company sells for $39,000 in China. Tesla’s Model Y SUV was the best-selling electric car in China in February with 4,630 units sold. Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) delivered 2,223 deliveries and Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) 707 units in the same month. Price Action: Volkswagen OTC shares closed nearly 5% lower at $34.15 on Friday.

(NYSE: GME) and at least up to 40% of the WSB forum loves silver. What Happened: Bayoukhi, the founder of the subreddit WallStreetSilver, told Kitco News that WSB users were behind the silver short-squeeze in January, despite the subreddit having earlier denied they were not the ones behind the metal’s rally. He claimed that one could find several silver-related posts if they just scrolled back five to six months on the WSB forum. Bayoukhi also said that he and others who tried to post about silver on WSB were banned from the Reddit forum as the majority of the members did not want the focus to deviate from GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. He added that the silver squeeze movement — that drove the market prices of iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), First Majestic Silver Corp (NYSE: AG), Comstock Mining Inc (AMEX: LODE), and Fortuna Silver Mines Inc (NYSE: FSM) higher earlier this year — is still ongoing and the number one goal of WallStreetSilver is to wake up “billions of people to getting silver.” See Also: Beyond WallStreetBets, Analyst Sees GameStop Benefiting From These 3 Factors Why It Matters: Silver prices rose earlier this year to an 8-year high amid speculation the Reddit investors-led short-squeeze rally that pushed up shares in GameStop and others has extended into the precious metals market. See also: How‌ ‌to‌ ‌Buy‌ ‌GameStop‌ ‌(GME)‌ ‌Stock‌ However, top posts on the WallStreetBets subreddit at that time said the silver trade was orchestrated by the very hedge funds the community was targeting. WallStreetBets posters accused Citadel LLC of pushing the silver short squeeze in an attempt to lure traders away from GameStop.

Southern District Court in New York interrupted the discussion to apparently suggest the <a href=\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/xrp\\\">XRP</a> cryptocurrency may not be a security as the SEC claims.</p>\\n<p>“My understanding about XRP is that not only does it have a currency value but it has a utility, and that utility distinguishes it from <a href=\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin\\\">bitcoin</a> and <a href=\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/price/ethereum\\\">ether</a>,” the judge said, according to Hogan.</p>\\n<p><strong>Related:

matter is at the heart of the SEC’s <a href=\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-sec-say-settlement-unlikely-before-trial-over-alleged-securities-violations\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">case</a> against Ripple because the regulator claims XRP had been sold by the company and its executives without either being registered as a security or the firm seeking an exemption.</p>\\n<p>“No matter what the SEC may try and argue, a currency and a security are, by definition, in opposite … These are two different things,” Hogan said. He added the judge offering the view that XRP has utility is “exactly what Ripple wants the court to be thinking.”</p>\\n<p>Netburn’s comments came during a virtual hearing, observed by Hogan, over the SEC’s <a href=\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-financial-records-subpoenas-sec\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">attempt to obtain</a> personal financial information from Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and Executive Chairman Chris Larsen.</p>\\n<p>The second “bombshell,” said Hogan, came as Netburn questioned whether “everyone who sold XRP – including you and me – are selling illegal securities” based on the SEC’s prior argument. The SEC attorney responded by saying that, under Section 4 of the Securities Act, only Ripple and its affiliates (meaning employees, Hogan said) could be accused of illegal sales.</p>\\n<p><strong>Related: </strong><a href=\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/peoples-bank-of-china-official-says-fully-anonymous-digital-yuan-not-feasible\\\">People's Bank of China Official Says

stressed he wasn’t offering legal advice.</p>\\n<p><strong><em>See also: <a href=\\\"https://www.coindesk.com/ripple-chris-larsen-sec-motion-dismiss\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Ripple’s Chris Larsen

such as discovery and mediation. </p>\\n<p>“If I’m Ripple, I’m feeling pretty good that my mediator and consulting summary judgment judge just said on the record what I essentially argued in my pleadings,” Hogen said.</p>\\n<p>There was no official court documentation on the hearing available at press time.</p>\\n<h2>Related Stories</h2>\\n<ul>\\n <li><a

Reserve’s Digital Dollar Momentum Worries Wall Street\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-digital-dollar-momentum-worries-060000433.html\",\"summary\":\"(Bloomberg) -- The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.Wall Street is not thrilled.Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.As soon as July, officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said James Cunha, who leads the project for the Boston Fed.A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for Compass Point Research & Trading LLC.Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.“The fire has been lit,” said Josh Lipsky, who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.In video remarks last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the American Bankers Association.The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a Morgan Stanley conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”Other countries are further along. China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.Brown earlier this month sent a letter to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by Facebook Inc. and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\"publisher\":\"Bloomberg\",\"author\":\"Joe Light\",\"type\":\"story\",\"entities\":[],\"offnet\":false,\"content\":\"<p>(Bloomberg) -- The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.</p>\\n<p>Wall Street is not thrilled.</p>\\n<p>Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.</p>\\n<p>As soon as July, officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said James Cunha, who leads the project for the Boston Fed.</p>\\n<p>A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.</p>\\n<p>Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.</p>\\n<p>“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for Compass Point Research &amp; Trading LLC.</p>\\n<p>Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away.

The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.</p>\\n<p>Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.</p>\\n<p>The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.</p>\\n<p>In video remarks last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”</p>\\n<p>Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.</p>\\n<p>The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.</p>\\n<p>“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”</p>\\n<p>The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.</p>\\n<p>So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.</p>\\n<p>“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the American Bankers Association.</p>\\n<p>The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.</p>\\n<p>Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.</p>\\n<p>Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.</p>\\n<p>Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.</p>\\n<p>Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.</p>\\n<p>“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a Morgan Stanley conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”</p>\\n<p>Other countries are further along. China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.</p>\\n<p>Brown earlier this month sent a letter to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.</p>\\n<p>Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by Facebook Inc. and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.</p>\\n<p>Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.</p>\\n<p>A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.</p>\\n<p>A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”</p>\\n<p>For more articles like this, please visit

another set of inflation data, though signs of a pronounced rise will likely be elusive for at least another month. A handful of earnings reports are also set for release.</p> \\n<p>On Friday, the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis will release its report on February personal consumption expenditures (PCE), or the change in value of goods and services purchased by the U.S. consumer. The core measure of PCE, which excludes more volatile food and energy prices, serves as the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge of underlying inflation in the U.S. economy.</p> \\n<p>Consensus economists expect to see headline PCE to rise by just 0.3% month-over-month to match January's tepid rate. Core PCE likely rose by an even smaller margin, or by 0.1% following a 0.3% January rise, according to consensus. And over last year, core PCE is expected to have risen by only 1.5%, holding well below the Federal Reserve's 2% target as it has for years.</p> \\n<p>But with the post-pandemic economic recovery under way — and not to mention trillions more pumped into the economy via the latest coronavirus relief package — many investors have been nervously looking for signs of rapid inflation. This, some fear, might prompt a tightening of financial conditions by the Federal Reserve and an increase in borrowing costs for companies and consumers. Signs of core PCE inflation are likely to start pushing decidedly higher this spring, since the year-over-year data will lap the depressed levels from the same period in 2020 when the start of the coronavirus pandemic weighed pronouncedly on economic activity.</p> \\n<p>Given these base effects, the Federal Reserve has maintained that inflation this year will be \\\"transitory,\\\" and will attenuate in the coming years. Still, the Fed earlier this month upgraded its outlook for core PCE inflation to 2.2% this year, from the 1.8% rise it saw in its December projection. The Fed has targeted 2.0% core PCE inflation, but has suggested it would tolerate above-target inflation for some time to compensate for years of undershooting in inflationary pressures.</p> \\n<p>\\\"Lift-off will not occur until the Fed becomes convinced this year’s temporary increase in inflation has been followed up by a more persistent inflation push modestly above its 2% target. This implies actual inflation will need to push beyond 2% for an extended period before the Fed will consider hiking short rates,\\\" Steven Ricchiuto, U.S. chief economist for Mizuho Securites USA, said in a note on Friday. \\\"Given the Fed’s recent forecast calls for its key inflation measure, the personal consumption expenditures deflator, to average only 2.0%-2.2% in 2023, lift-off is likely to occur later than is generally expected.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Still, markets have suggested they will need to see more proof. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield broke to a more than one-year high of 1.75% last week, climbing by nearly 50 basis points from levels one month ago, in anticipation both of a strong economic recovery and of firming inflation.</p> \\n<p>\\\"The Fed tends to think as an economist, and economists look through changes over time. Markets tend to live more in the moment,\\\" Mohamed El-Erian, <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/fed-risks-losing-control-bond-133737328.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">Allianz chief economic advisor, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday.</a></p> \\n<p>\\\"If inflation is going up, the marketplace is saying, I'm not so sure it's transitory. Prove to me it's transitory. And that's the difficulty the Fed has,\\\" he added. \\\"We are seeing supply bottlenecks multiply. And for me, I do think inflation will go up. I do think it's not going to be a permanent inflationary process. But the market is not going to look through that as easily as the Fed would like it to.\\\"</p> \\n<h2>GameStop earnings</h2> \\n<h2></h2> \\n<p>While the fourth-quarter corporate earnings season has slowed down, a small number of notable companies are still set to report results this week.</p> \\n<p>GameStop (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">GME</a>), the poster child for the latest surge in retail investor interest in the stock market, is set to report fourth-quarter results Tuesday afternoon.</p> \\n<p>However, in the eyes of many Wall Street analysts, GameStop shares have not been trading according to fundamentals like earnings results this year. Instead, shares have been pushed astronomically higher by a frenzy of speculative interest among traders, many of whom have convened on forums like Reddit to discuss the potential for the stock.</p> \\n<p>The stock was identified as a target for a short squeeze in January due to its elevated short interest, prompting a flood of purchases to force shorts to cover their bets and push the stock still-higher. The stock peaked at $483 intraday on January 28, after closing the final trading day of 2020 at just $18.84. Shares have since come back down to $202.44 apiece, holding onto a year-to-date gain of 970%.</p> \\n<p>With a market capitalization hovering around $14 billion as of Friday, it has quickly vaulted to become one of the biggest companies in the small-cap Russell 2000 index (<a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5ERUT?p=%5ERUT\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">^RUT</a>).

GameStop announced in early February that it had brought on Matt Francis, a former engineering leader from Amazon Web Services, <a href=\\\"https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">as its first-ever chief technology officer. </a>Later that month, the company announced its <a href=\\\"https://investor.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">Chief Financial Officer Jim Bell would be resigning </a>— news that was taken as a positive by investors on social media, and <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-stop-shares-close-104-higher-in-afternoon-rally-up-another-100-in-after-hours-215604847.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">catalyzing a more than doubling in the stock at the time</a>.</p> \\n<figure>\\n <img src=\\\"https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2021-02/1460f360-78f9-11eb-bbfc-9b77b0679a2a\\\" alt=\\\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - FEBRUARY 25: A man talks by his phone in front of GameStop at 6th Avenue on February 25, 2021 in New York.

Keith Gill — the user known as \\\"Roaring Kitty\\\" on some social media platforms, and whose posts and comments have been viewed as a galvanizing force behind the GameStop rally — <a href=\\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exvT9POUPmo\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">told the House Financial Services Committee in February</a> that he believed the company had \\\"a unique opportunity to pivot toward a technology-driven business,\\\" and that \\\"by embracing the digital economy, GameStop may be able to find new revenue streams that vastly exceed the value of its business.\\\"</p> \\n<p>Most Wall Street analysts, however, are not convinced. The stock had zero Buy, 4 Hold and 3 Sell ratings as of Friday, according to Bloomberg data. <a href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/game-stop-has-been-a-debacle-of-epic-proportions-analyst-171133390.html\\\" target=\\\"_self\\\">Some firms, including Loop Capital Markets</a>, suspended coverage of the stock in the wake of the January rally, citing a massive disconnect between the stock's fundamentals and valuation.</p> \\n<p>Consensus analysts expect GameStop to report revenue of $2.21 billion for the three months ending in January. That would mark a rise of 1% over the same period last year, and end an eight-quarter streak of declining revenues. Adjusted earnings likely totaled $1.43 per share, according to consensus estimates. Net income likely totaled $106.9 million in the fourth quarter, though the company is expected to still post its third consecutive full-year net loss at $188.7 million.</p> \\n<h2>Economic

with some news on its battery plans and images for a new SUV. What Happened: Lucid Motors, which is going public with Churchill Capital Corp IV (NYSE: CCIV), has unveiled plans to put its batteries to use in the energy storage market. TechCrunch reported that Lucid Motors sees a second life for its electric vehicle batteries in the energy storage space. Lucid Motors is experimenting with energy storage systems for both commercial and residential customers. Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of 70% after being removed from an electric vehicle. Lucid Motors wants ways to repurpose the batteries going forward. New images also circulated online showing the Lucid Motors Gravity SUV. Electrek shared images that were filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office. The images differ from pictures the company had previously shared, including during its investor presentation. Changes include ore glass to the roof and a longer back.

The company is also working to complete its SPAC merger with Churchill Capital Corp IV. The new battery plans and leaked images for the Gravity could help boost investor confidence in the long-term plans for Lucid Motors. The Gravity SUV is scheduled to be released in 2023. Plans are underway to complete Phase II of the company’s Arizona production facility that could make space for Gravity production. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson told Jim Cramer on “Mad Money” last week that the company’s order book was filling up. The CEO said the company plans to ramp up production in the third quarter of 2023 to 85,000 vehicles annually from the Arizona factory. The planned expansion for the facility could bring capacity to 365,000 units annually. Price Action: Shares of Churchill Capital Corp IV closed at $26.88 on Friday.

(NYSE: XPEV) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI), more details have emerged. What Happened: Nio is availing the services of Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley for assisting with its Hong Kong listing, an IFR report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Nio is reportedly looking to offload a 5% stake, valued at around $3.4 billion, in a secondary listing. The valuation is calculated based on Friday's closing price of Nio's ADS listed on the NYSE. The report further said Xpeng has hired Bank of America and JPMorgan and Li Auto is working with Goldman Sachs and UBS, for their respective Hong Kong listings. Spokespersons of Xpeng and Nio declined to comment on the report, when contacted by Benzinga. Related Link: Is The Nio Sell-Off Overdone? Since Xpeng and Li Auto do not satisfy the norm of having a good track record of a minimum of two financial years of regulatory compliance with the standards of another qualifying exchange, these two companies may not be eligible for secondary listings, the IFR report said. Instead, these companies may have to take the route of dual primary listing that will be allowed with additional disclosures, according to the report. Xpeng ADSs were listed on the NYSE on Aug. 27 and Li Auto began trading on the Nasdaq on July 30. Why It's Important: Demand from investors in Asia has been on the rise, as evidenced by the homecoming of several U.S.-listed Chinese companies. For companies such as Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto, which operate in a cash-intensive industry, any leeway to raise further cash without the accompanying financial burden is a welcome outcome. See also: How to Buy XPeng Motors (XPEV) Stock Apart from adding to their product lineup, these companies are investing heavily in technology and service offerings. After a volatile run in much of February, Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto are all trading notably off their highs. Nio settled Friday's session up 4.13% to $43.35, Xpeng rallied 7.09% to $37.48 and Li Auto added 4.87% to $26.28. Related Link: A New Rival To Tesla And Nio?

That’s down from previous charges that varied between 0.25% and 0.30%. Those products -- which focus on specific approaches such as company size and growth or value investing -- are now tracking the Morningstar Broad Style Indexes that were launched in January.Fees have emerged as a battleground in the quickly growing $6 trillion ETF industry, where competition has prompted some of the biggest funds to slash costs to industry lows. BlackRock has been locked in a contest with runner-up Vanguard Group for flows, with the latter winning last year for the first time since 2013. Meanwhile, once-niche issuers such as Cathie Wood’s Ark Investment Management have jumped up the leaderboard as investors swarm to theme-friendly funds.The decision on cutting fees reflects BlackRock’s commitment to being the leading ETF provider in all segments of the industry, including the burgeoning thematics arena, according to the head of iShares Americas Armando Senra. Back in June, BlackRock lowered the expense ratio of its largest fund -- the $258 billion iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF -- to 0.03% in order to match a rival product from Vanguard.“We wanted to be incredibly competitive in the market for that cost-conscious buyer,” Senra said in a phone interview.Prior to the fee cuts, BlackRock’s style ETFs were expensive relative to peers. The biggest of the collection, the $2.3 billion iShares Morningstar Growth ETF -- formerly known as the iShares Morningstar Large-Cap Growth ETF -- has an expense ratio of 0.04%, versus 0.25% previously. That brings the fund in line with the fee on the $68 billion Vanguard Growth ETF.In addition to the sweeping changes, the style funds have also undergone share splits of varying ratios. Senra said that model portfolios -- both BlackRock’s own and those created by outside firms -- are a key area of focus for the company.

Exits Apollo Ahead of Schedule and Cedes Chairman Role\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leon-black-steps-down-apollo-113045518.html\",\"summary\":\"(Bloomberg) -- Leon Black, the Wall Street billionaire who appeared to be a main client of disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, is stepping down as chief executive officer of Apollo Global Management Inc. months ahead of schedule.Black’s departure from that role had been announced in January, though the firm said at the time that he would leave by July 1. A statement Monday confirmed his immediate exit from the position as well as the chairmanship he’d been expected to keep.Co-founder Marc Rowan has taken over as CEO, Jay Clayton was named non-executive chairman, and Apollo added two more independent directors to its board, according to the statement.It’s an abrupt turn for Black, 69, a Wall Street legend who built Apollo into one of the most fearsome -- and profitable -- names in American finance.

      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " On Feb. 26, DoorDash surveyed its more than 1 million independent drivers, asking them to share \\\"experiences\\\" about deliveries for Walmart. \\\"We heard your feedback. Make Walmart orders better,\\\" the survey says, according to a version Reuters has seen that DoorDash confirmed as authentic.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " As DoorDash expands beyond its urban restaurant roots to the delivery of everything - from groceries to gardening tools - across the country, it has run into etiquette issues. Americans who are used to tipping for burgers or burritos do not always think to tip for delivery of household goods or pet food. After all, they do not tip for postal, UPS or Amazon deliveries.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " CEO Doug McMillon last month said delivery is key to its Walmart+ subscription program, launched in September. The program, which costs $98 a year, offers unlimited grocery and merchandise delivery on orders over $35 from Walmart stores.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " \\\"Logistics and delivery will continue to be a bit of a pain point for Walmart because they view it as a place where they could potentially reduce costs,\\\" said Chad Oviatt, director of investment at Walmart shareholder Huntington Private Bank.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " Partnering with Walmart has helped DoorDash take market share from rivals including Grubhub Inc and tap into new pockets of demand for delivery in suburban areas, where many Walmart stores are located.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " But some DoorDash drivers complain of heavy loads and long waits for picking up parcels at stores. Customer tips are another sore point, especially for drivers who are used to getting bigger tips on restaurant orders, several people said.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " After her day job, DoorDash driver Kat Ensey, 53, makes money delivering sandwiches and sodas outside of Chicago. Bringing Walmart orders to shoppers' homes is less profitable, she said. Ensey, standing 5 feet-2-inches tall, recalled once hauling 13, 30-pound bags of soil from her car through a muddy yard to a Walmart customer's back patio. DoorDash paid her $4 for the delivery. The customer did not tip.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " Until last fall, Walmart's app, which takes customers' delivery orders, did not allow shoppers to include tips up front. Instacart Inc - a third-party service that handles deliveries for Kroger Co and other grocers - includes a pre-delivery tip of $2, and Amazon.com Inc's Whole Foods and Amazon Fresh include a $7 tip. Customers can then change the amounts.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " DoorDash said it approached Walmart last year about allowing customers to add a tip to their order before they finalize a purchase. A spokeswoman for Walmart said this was \\\"a great idea\\\" and changed its app in October to allow online shoppers to tip before they pay for their order.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " Since that move, she said, 75% of Walmart shoppers allocate tips. But the DoorDash spokeswoman said the company did not finish updating its own app until late February, so drivers could not see tips before deciding to accept a delivery.\n",

      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",
      "<p>\n",
      " The document also promised \\\"there are more changes on the horizon\\\" pertaining to its relationship with Walmart, though it did not specify what those are. DoorDash declined to provide the survey results to Reuters or elaborate on future changes.\n",
      "</p>\n",
      "\\n\n",

      " Walmart said it has taken several measures to speed online orders for pickup and delivery, including raising the number of personal shoppers in stores to more than 170,000 from over 63,000 in November 2019, a move that could help reduce how long drivers wait for parcels.\n",

Stocks Top Analysts Are Heavily Bullish On Heading Into April\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/five-stocks-top-analysts-heavily-101955749.html\",\"summary\":\"Despite inflation fears as the economy reopens after a wider COVID-19 vaccination rollout, there are stocks that analysts are highly bullish on. Here’s a list of best-performing Wall Street analysts’ top five stocks with “Buy” ratings, as compiled by TipRanks. Amazon Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN): Baird analyst Colin Sebastian has reiterated a “Buy” rating and has a $4,000 price target in addition to a “Fresh Pick” status on the e-commerce giant. Colin has support from 30 other top analysts who have a “Buy” rating as well, as per TipRanks. Sebastian noted that investors could be missing \\\"one of the most compelling subscription/quasi-subscription models within the Internet and Technology sectors,” adding that 75% of Amazon’s revenue is recurring even as it keeps adding new subscribers effectively. Baird sees Amazon as \\\"significantly undervalued\\\" and can see it headed to $5,000 per share in the medium-term. See Also: Will Amazon Stock Reach ,000 By 2022? With a 75% success rate and 34.8% average return per rating, Sebastian is ranked 28 out of over 7,000 analysts tracked by TipRanks. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT): Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives maintained a “Buy” rating and a $300 price target on the stock as he sees cloud growth momentum building up for the company. The rest of the Wall Street analysts are bullish as well with a total of 23 “Buy” ratings on the stock. Ives estimates that cloud wars between Amazon and Microsoft to capture market share are going to intensify and global cloud spending could reach nearly $1 trillion over the next decade. The veteran analyst has predicted a shift in tide in the cloud space, with Microsoft standing to benefit. See also: How To Buy Microsoft Stock Alphatec Holdings (NASDAQ: ATEC): Medical technology company focused on spinal surgeries has six “Buy” ratings from top analysts and a $19.7 average stock price forecast. H.C. Wainwright analyst Sean Lee, who claims a 75% success rate and 69.2% average return per rating, has maintained a “Buy” rating on the stock and raised the price target to $19 from $16. Lee’s rating comes after the company’s fourth-quarter revenue registered a 36% year-over-year surge despite the ongoing COVID-19 headwinds. The analyst expects EOS imaging to be a key growth driver for the company, contributing about $127 million in additional revenues by 2025. Alphatec's recently-launched procedure for lateral surgeries that significantly shortens the surgery times could also be a major growth driver this year. Addus Homecare Corp (NASDAQ: ADUS): Brokerage RBC Capital analyst Frank Morgan, who has a 5-star rating on the stock, has reiterated a \\\"Buy\\\" rating and a price target of $136. The Texas-based home and healthcare company recently unveiled a new value plan to support closer coordination of care for patients as they are discharged from acute care hospitals into their homes or into post-acute facilities. Morgan believes the plan “positions Addus for a larger role in post-acute coordination with potential for longer-term shared savings.” The analyst is also encouraged by the recently passed COVID federal relief aid as “it provides a 10% boost to the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage meant to bolster personal care services amid the pandemic.” This increase gives a larger match than Morgan originally expected, with earlier versions of the bill mentioning a 7.35% rise. Amyris Inc (NASDAQ: AMRS): H.C. Wainwright analyst Amit Dayal is bullish on the stock and has significantly roasted its price target to $35 from $11 and reiterated the “Buy” rating as well. Dayal, who has a 77% average per rating, along with three top analysts, has a similar view on the stock in the last two months. The average analyst price target comes in at $25.50. Dayal sees improving business fundamentals that support the company’s annual revenue growth outlook expectations of between 30% and 50% over the next few years. Also, its debt is set to land below $100 million by the end of the third quarter this year from $297 million at the beginning of 2020. The brokerage says the company currently has 18 ingredients currently in development that could position the company to have more than 30 commercialized ingredients by the end of 2025. In addition, it has four new brand launches in 2021, is expanding its retail presence, and could benefit from acquisitions and distribution agreements in international markets including China and Brazil. Based on all of the above, the analyst argues that revenues will grow at a nine-year CAGR from 2021 to 2030 of 28.8%, versus the previous 20.4% estimate.

Monster Growth Stocks With Potential for Further Gains\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-monster-growth-stocks-potential-185827558.html\",\"summary\":\"At the end of the day, investors want to see returns. To accomplish this goal, seasoned Wall Street observers often turn to one strategy time and time again: growth investing. A solid growth play is a name that appears poised to not only grow at an above-average rate but also reward investors handsomely over the long run. Rolling up their sleeves, investors are pounding the Wall Street pavement in search of the tickers with impressive long-term growth prospects. However, having a target in mind is one thing, but zeroing in on these stocks primed for gains in the coming years is another story entirely. With this in mind, we suited up and set out on our own hunt for the investment opportunities with strong growth narratives. Using TipRanks' Database, we were able to pinpoint 3 Buy-rated tickers that each boast considerable upside potential, according to Wall Street’s analysts. Cowen Group (COWN) We’ll start with Cowen Group, a New York-based investment bank. Cowen offers services in investment management and broker-dealing, and is known as a risk taker willing to move early into disruptive sectors; Cowen was an early booster of high-tech dot.com stocks, and more recently in the cannabis sector. The bank’s main operations are in the US and the UK. The bank’s recent share growth has been extreme; since this time last year, COWN shares are up 534%. The share appreciation has pushed the company’s market cap over $1 billion, and brought investors solid returns during the difficult corona crisis. After a turndown in 1Q20, the company showed three consecutive quarters in a row of year-over-year revenue and earnings gains. Those gains were particularly impressive in Q2 and Q4; looking at 4Q20, the most recent reported, Cowen posted a record quarterly net income of $90.5 million, by GAAP measures; full-year income was $209.6 million. The gains were driven by record performance in both the investment banking and the brokerage divisions. Cowen’s performance has impressed 5-star analyst Sumeet Mody, of Piper Sandler, who writes: “We remain very positive on COWN following the strong results of 4Q20 earnings. After the firm's sustained and elevated brokerage and banking activity throughout 2020, the outlook for earnings has meaningfully improved as banking pipelines remain robust and brokerage activity has started the year strong... The beat was broad based across the business lines, but largely driven by higher-than-expected investment banking and brokerage revenues as well as lower expense ratios.” To this end, Mody rates Cowen shares an Overweight (i.e. Buy), and his $71 price target suggests room for a 78% one-year upside from current levels. (To watch Mody’s track record, click here) The Piper Sandler analyst is the bullish outlier here, but Wall Street, for the most part, agrees with him on Cowen, as shown by the 3 to 1 split favoring Buy to Hold reviews. Shares are priced at $39.86 and their $47 average price target implies an upside of ~18% for the coming year. (See COWN stock analysis on TipRanks) Commercial Vehicle Group (CVGI) Talk about the automotive industry, and you’ll naturally start talking about the car companies. But the industry is more than that – there is a whole network of part suppliers and service companies that support the automakers, and Commercial Vehicle Group lives in that niche. The company supplies a variety services to the automotive sector, including warehouse automation, robotic assemblies, seating systems, plastic products, EV assemblies, and mechanical assemblies. Commercial Vehicle Group’s customer base includes the commercial truck industry, electric vehicle makers, and the ecommerce warehousing industry. The big story here, for CVG, has been the company’s warehouse automation segment. The corona crisis inspired a massive push toward ecommerce, and CVG has been a beneficiary of that move. The company’s warehouse automation segment saw higher volume in 2020 – and greater efficiency due to cost reduction actions during the year. Q4 revenues topped $216 million, a gain of 14% year-over-year. Operating income for the quarter was $5 million, a gain of $9.3 million year-over-year. The quarterly results marked the first year-over-year quarterly gains for the company in 2020, and come in after the company’s shares have consistently outperformed during the year. Shares in CVGI are up 543% in the last 12 months – far outpacing the broader markets. In a move that bodes well for the future, CVG announced at the beginning of this month a partnership with Xos, a commercial EV manufacturer, for the development of sustainability initiatives. Covering this stock for Barrington, 5-star analyst Christopher Howe was impressed by the company’s backlog of new business. “The company achieved net new business wins of more than $100 million annualized in 2020, primarily driven by warehouse automation and electric vehicles, all of which is expected to convert this year. Moving forward, it expects to achieve another $100 million of net new business wins in 2021,” Howe noted. The analyst added “[EV] activity is robust [and] the company anticipates these programs to remain in the development phase through 2021, later converting into revenue once product baselines have stabilized. In regard to warehouse automation, according to Logistics IQ, demand for warehouse automation products is expected to grow approximately 14% per year through 2026.” In light of these comments, Howe rates CVGI shares an Outperform (i.e. Buy), with a $14 price target to indicate a one-year upside of 39%. (To watch Howe’s track record, click here) There are two analyst reviews on file for this company, and they both agree: CVGI is a stock to buy. The shares have an average price target of $14, matching Howe’s. (See CVGI stock analysis on TipRanks) Zedge, Inc. (ZDGE) We’ll wrap up our look at growth stocks with a denizen of the software industry, Zedge. This company offers customization options for smartphones, which have proven to be highly popular. Zedge’s platform offers wallpapers, ringtones, app icons, widgets, and notification sounds, among other features. The Zedge app boasts over 450 million installs, and more than 30 million monthly active users – key metrics in the smartphone app universe. But perhaps the most telling statistic is this: Zedge has consistently been in the top 25 free apps on Google Play for the past seven years. That kind of popularity gives a software company a solid foundation, and Zedge’s shares have reaped the benefits. The stock is up an astounding 932% in just the past 6 months, growth that has coincided with growing revenues. Zedge has seen 5 quarters in a row of year-over-year top line growth. The company reported its fiscal 2Q21 results on March 15, and the results were record-breaking for the company. Revenue came in at $5.3 million, net income at $2.3 million, and EPS at 17 cents. Monthly active users hit 35.4 million. The revenue number represented a 101% gain year-over-year; the EPS was up from just 1 cent in the prior year. After these gangbuster results, Zedge revised its full-year 2021 revenue guidance upward to a prediction of 75% to 80% growth. Analyst Allen Klee, of Maxim Group, is impressed with Zedge, and sees a clear path forward for the company. “Zedge is accelerating growth from its advertising platform and new offerings. We expect the company to strengthen its ecosystem so that the 35M monthly active users will be more engaged in the platform resulting in better retention and monetization. We also expect 2021 to have catalysts from growing the short-form story telling of Shortz and new entertainment-like podcasts,” Klee opined. Based on all of the above, Klee puts a Buy rating on ZDGE shares, along with a $24 price target. This target conveys Klee's confidence in Zedge's ability to climb 57% higher in the next twelve months. Some stocks fly under the radar, and ZDGE is one of those. Zedge's is the only recent analyst review of this company, and it is decidedly positive.

Heats Up China EV Competition As It Begins Deliveries Of ID.4 Crozz SUV\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volkswagen-heats-china-ev-competition-055228302.html\",\"summary\":\"A joint venture between Volkswagen AG (OTC: VWAGY) and China’s state-owned First Automobile Works delivered its first electric sports utility vehicle — the SUV ID.4 Crozz — to 12 customers over the weekend in Shenzhen. What Happened: The SUV, available in five models, ranges in price between RMB 199,000 ($30,720) to RMB 279,900 ($43,000) after subsidies and has a range of between 400 KM (248 Miles) to 550 KM (342 Miles), CnEVPost reported. The SUV is built on Volkswagen’s $7 billion modular MEB platform and is considered the first truly competitive vehicle for the Chinese market for the joint venture, as per CnEVPost. The MEB plant of the JV — located in Foshan, Guangdong province — currently produces in excess of 600,000 units and is expected to make 770,000 units by 2024. Why It Matters: Volkswagen OTC shares have soared 68.2% since the year began and rose 29.25% higher last Wednesday alone after the company revealed its technology roadmap for batteries and charging up to 2030. Wuling Motors — a joint venture between General Motors Compay (NYSE: GM) and state-owned SAIC Motor — has also found success with its Hong Guang Mini EV, which sells for $4,500 in China. The two-door car outsold Tesla Inc’s (NASDAQ: TSLA) Model 3 last month. The sedan made by the Elon Musk-led company sells for $39,000 in China. Tesla’s Model Y SUV was the best-selling electric car in China in February with 4,630 units sold. Xpeng Inc (NYSE: XPEV) delivered 2,223 deliveries and Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) 707 units in the same month. Price Action: Volkswagen OTC shares closed nearly 5% lower at $34.15 on Friday.

(NYSE: GME) and at least up to 40% of the WSB forum loves silver. What Happened: Bayoukhi, the founder of the subreddit WallStreetSilver, told Kitco News that WSB users were behind the silver short-squeeze in January, despite the subreddit having earlier denied they were not the ones behind the metal’s rally. He claimed that one could find several silver-related posts if they just scrolled back five to six months on the WSB forum. Bayoukhi also said that he and others who tried to post about silver on WSB were banned from the Reddit forum as the majority of the members did not want the focus to deviate from GameStop and other heavily shorted stocks. He added that the silver squeeze movement — that drove the market prices of iShares Silver Trust (NYSE: SLV), First Majestic Silver Corp (NYSE: AG), Comstock Mining Inc (AMEX: LODE), and Fortuna Silver Mines Inc (NYSE: FSM) higher earlier this year — is still ongoing and the number one goal of WallStreetSilver is to wake up “billions of people to getting silver.” See Also: Beyond WallStreetBets, Analyst Sees GameStop Benefiting From These 3 Factors Why It Matters: Silver prices rose earlier this year to an 8-year high amid speculation the Reddit investors-led short-squeeze rally that pushed up shares in GameStop and others has extended into the precious metals market.

Peter Hug, the global trading director for Kitco Metals, had said that while there was ample supply of larger silver investment products, the pandemic had created a shortage of smaller coins and bars.

Reserve’s Digital Dollar Momentum Worries Wall Street\",\"link\":\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/federal-digital-dollar-momentum-worries-060000433.html\",\"summary\":\"(Bloomberg) -- The financial services industry, braced for what could be its biggest disruption in decades, is about to get an early glimpse at the Federal Reserve’s work on a new digital currency.Wall Street is not thrilled.Banks, credit card companies and digital payments processors are nervously watching the push to create an electronic alternative to the paper bills Americans carry in their wallets, or what some call a digital dollar and others call a Fedcoin.As soon as July, officials at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which have been developing prototypes for a digital dollar platform, plan to unveil their research, said James Cunha, who leads the project for the Boston Fed.A digital currency could fundamentally change the way Americans use money, leading some financial firms to lobby the Fed and Congress to slow its creation -- or at least ensure they’re not cut out.Seeing the threat to their profits, the banks’ main trade group has told Congress a digital dollar isn’t needed, while payment companies like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. are trying to work with central banks to make sure the new currencies can be used on their networks.“Everyone is afraid that you could disrupt all the incumbent players with a whole new form of payment,” said Michael Del Grosso, an analyst for Compass Point Research &amp; Trading LLC.Lawmakers, U.S. Treasury Department officials and the Fed haven’t yet approved the rollout of a U.S. virtual currency, which could still be years away. Nor have they decided how a digital dollar would interact with the existing global payments network. Still, the U.S. and other countries seem committed enough to digitizing their currencies that it’s making financial industry executives nervous.“The fire has been lit,” said Josh Lipsky, who has helped convene government officials from the U.S. and other countries working on digital currencies as director of the GeoEconomics Center at the Atlantic Council. “The world is moving very quickly on these projects.”At issue are forms of digital cash being considered by the U.S. and other governments. The growing popularity of Bitcoin, Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies, whose market value has grown to more than $1 trillion, inspired the projects. Unlike those privately created tokens, the new currencies would be issued by central banks as an alternative to paper bills. Cash wouldn’t go away, but its use would likely decline.Using the currencies could be as simple as holding up the screen of a mobile phone to be scanned. Behind the scenes, the digital cash would move from one account to another. This is similar to how most money already works -- the majority of U.S. dollars are just digital entries in bank accounts -- but the new currency could potentially avoid the go-between of a commercial bank or credit-card network. For vendors, settlement would happen almost immediately, without having to wait for the money or worry about fraud.The U.S. effort got an extra push last month, when Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said such a project could help Americans who don’t have access to the banking system.In video remarks last week to a payments conference in Basel, Switzerland, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell may have eased some of the banks’ concerns when he said “digital currencies would need to be integrated into existing payment systems alongside cash and other forms of money.”Cunha said the Boston Fed and MIT hope to unveil some of their work in the third quarter, including at least two prototype software platforms that could move, store and settle transactions made with digital dollars. He wouldn’t say if either platform uses the blockchain technology that underlies Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Once the prototypes are released, Cunha said, others will be able to see and build on the code.The Fed’s work is meant to show what’s possible without taking a stand on major issues that the central bank, Treasury and Congress must address, Cunha said. These include whether the Fed itself should host customer accounts, whether to allow anonymity, and what protections consumers would have in case of a cyber-breach or mistaken transaction.“We think it’s important that we not wait for the policy debate because then we’ll be a year or so behind,” Cunha said. “This will take significant outreach to the industry and serious debate.”The potential that the central bank could cut banks out of their middleman role in the lucrative U.S. payments system is causing angst among banks.So is the push coming from Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown, the new chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. Brown is urging the Fed to move quickly to create digital-currency accounts for Americans who can’t easily access the financial system and have been forced to deal with payday lenders who charge higher fees and interest rates. Brown’s plan could threaten the deposits that commercial banks rely on to make mortgages and other loans.“Rushing anything of this potential magnitude could introduce unintended consequences that threaten the stability of the banking system without contributing meaningfully to economic inclusion,” said Steve Kenneally, senior vice president of payments at the American Bankers Association.The ABA, which says it’s lobbying Congress on the issue, last year in written testimony called the digital dollar a costly solution in search of a nonexistent problem.Two lobbyists for a large bank said they’re in contact with lawmakers to keep track of the issue. They expect lobbying to pick up once banks can actually see the Fed’s work and how it might affect them, said the lobbyists, who requested anonymity to discuss internal conversations.Interest in a digital currency has gathered momentum in part because many banks take days to give consumers access to checks deposited in their accounts and some charge stiff overdraft fees. Those without bank accounts sometimes must pay high fees to cash paychecks or transmit money to relatives.Some of the profits of credit-card companies, such as Visa and Mastercard, could be at risk if the new currencies let Americans more easily make transactions without their involvement and fees.Spokespeople from both companies say their firms are working with central banks to ensure the new currencies can run over their networks. Mastercard in February began to issue pre-paid debit cards loaded with the “Sand Dollar,” a digital currency issued by the Bahamas.“We’re increasingly having conversations with central banks as they think about designing potential central bank digital currency, CBDC, and we’re talking to them about how they think about design,” said Visa’s North America president Oliver Jenkyn, at a Morgan Stanley conference earlier this month. “So there’s a lot of talking, but there’s actually a lot of action alongside it as well.”Other countries are further along. China is currently piloting a digital yuan in several cities. Lipsky said there’s a chance its currency could be ready for a broader debut at the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, which he said could cause tensions if American athletes are asked to use a currency that the Chinese government can completely track.Brown earlier this month sent a letter to Powell urging him to speed up the research. “We cannot be left behind,” Brown wrote.Among other threats, Brown pointed to the development by Facebook Inc. and other companies of their own cryptocurrency, once called Libra. That currency, since renamed Diem, was slated to launch in 2020 but has struggled to win regulatory approval.Advocates of existing cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, have mixed feelings about the Federal Reserve muscling into the industry.A Fedcoin could acclimate Americans to purchasing Bitcoin, said Jerry Brito, who heads Coin Center, a cryptocurrency advocacy group. But depending on the government’s direction, such a currency could be used to track Americans’ spending, destroying the partial anonymity that was once the promise of crypto, he said.A U.S. digital dollar could also put the final nail in the coffin for Bitcoin as a means of exchange, Brito said. Crypto enthusiasts have already started to acknowledge that’s happening anyway, and instead tout the currency as a store of value or “digital gold.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.comSubscribe now to stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.©2021 Bloomberg L.P.\",\"publisher\":\"Bloomberg\",\"author\":\"Joe Light\",\"type\":\"story\",\"entities\":[],\"offnet\":false,\"content\":\"\n",

What Happened: Lucid Motors, which is going public with Churchill Capital Corp IV (NYSE: CCIV), has unveiled plans to put its batteries to use in the energy storage market. TechCrunch reported that Lucid Motors sees a second life for its electric vehicle batteries in the energy storage space. Lucid Motors is experimenting with energy storage systems for both commercial and residential customers. Batteries typically retain a charging capacity of 70% after being removed from an electric vehicle. Lucid Motors wants ways to repurpose the batteries going forward. New images also circulated online showing the Lucid Motors Gravity SUV. Electrek shared images that were filed with the European Union Intellectual Property Office. The images differ from pictures the company had previously shared, including during its investor presentation. Changes include ore glass to the roof and a longer back. Related Link: 9 Key Takeaways From The Lucid Motors SPAC Merger Why It’s Important: Lucid Motors is set to deliver its Lucid Air electric vehicle in the second half of 2021. The company is also working to complete its SPAC merger with Churchill Capital Corp IV. The new battery plans and leaked images for the Gravity could help boost investor confidence in the long-term plans for Lucid Motors. The Gravity SUV is scheduled to be released in 2023. Plans are underway to complete Phase II of the company’s Arizona production facility that could make space for Gravity production. Lucid Motors CEO Peter Rawlinson told Jim Cramer on “Mad Money” last week that the company’s order book was filling up. The CEO said the company plans to ramp up production in the third quarter of 2023 to 85,000 vehicles annually from the Arizona factory. The planned expansion for the facility could bring capacity to 365,000 units annually. Price Action: Shares of Churchill Capital Corp IV closed at $26.88 on Friday.

(NYSE: XPEV) and Li Auto Inc. (NASDAQ: LI), more details have emerged. What Happened: Nio is availing the services of Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley for assisting with its Hong Kong listing, an IFR report said, citing people familiar with the matter. Nio is reportedly looking to offload a 5% stake, valued at around $3.4 billion, in a secondary listing. The valuation is calculated based on Friday's closing price of Nio's ADS listed on the NYSE. The report further said Xpeng has hired Bank of America and JPMorgan and Li Auto is working with Goldman Sachs and UBS, for their respective Hong Kong listings. Spokespersons of Xpeng and Nio declined to comment on the report, when contacted by Benzinga. Related Link: Is The Nio Sell-Off Overdone? Since Xpeng and Li Auto do not satisfy the norm of having a good track record of a minimum of two financial years of regulatory compliance with the standards of another qualifying exchange, these two companies may not be eligible for secondary listings, the IFR report said. Instead, these companies may have to take the route of dual primary listing that will be allowed with additional disclosures, according to the report. Xpeng ADSs were listed on the NYSE on Aug. 27 and Li Auto began trading on the Nasdaq on July 30. Why It's Important: Demand from investors in Asia has been on the rise, as evidenced by the homecoming of several U.S.-listed Chinese companies. For companies such as Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto, which operate in a cash-intensive industry, any leeway to raise further cash without the accompanying financial burden is a welcome outcome. See also: How to Buy XPeng Motors (XPEV) Stock Apart from adding to their product lineup, these companies are investing heavily in technology and service offerings. After a volatile run in much of February, Nio, Xpeng and Li Auto are all trading notably off their highs. Nio settled Friday's session up 4.13% to $43.35, Xpeng rallied 7.09% to $37.48 and Li Auto added 4.87% to $26.28. Related Link: A New Rival To Tesla And Nio?
