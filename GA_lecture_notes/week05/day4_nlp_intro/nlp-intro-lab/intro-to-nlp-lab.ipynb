       "  'There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied\\nthat the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of\\npeople living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.\\n\\nThis doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used\\ndifferently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes\\nhappens that someone says \"My grandson is the cutest baby!\" and then turns\\naround and sees the granddaughter and says \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest thing!?\"\\n\\nThis person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the\\nworld according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for\\nfirst.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very\\nobject-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is\\noften at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly\\nliterally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,\\nit is not.\\n\\n\\nTurning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from\\nJohn E King:\\n\\n\\nNo, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say\\n\"Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way\\nto get from `fishing nets\\' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.\\n\\nIn other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal\\nreading, they could read this passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" means \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit is hardly a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\'s only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but\\nit\\'s at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut supposing 22,000 people is a \"small town\" -- it\\'s still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predicted.\\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quotes God as saying \"he and his army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he led against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\'s ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says\\nthat N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.\\n\\nRegardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before\\nthe place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThis post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability\\nto rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26\\nby pulling some \"clear implications\" out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your towers\", that clearly implied\\nthat the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers\\nused to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine houses\\nand throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea\", that clearly implied\\nthat N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your walls\", that clearly implies that N. would\\nspend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwalls.\\n\\nSee?  A few \"clear implications\" that are totally contrary to the text, and\\nyou can reconcile anything you want.\\n',\n",
       "  'About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to\\nbe very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if\\nanyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published \\nsolutions to it.\\n\\n\\tThe problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two\\nroughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially\\nstarts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the \\nedge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant\\nbetween the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw \\nthe object we \\n\\n1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively\\n\\tcomputed as a sequence of line segments approximating the\\n        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not\\n\\texactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two\\n\\ttriangles which will be filled in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangles\\n4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is\\n\\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolored with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the\\nproblem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.\\nThe net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in\\nthe edge of the surface.

       "  \"Sorry I missed you Raymond, I was just out in Dahlgren last month...\\n\\nI'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I\\ncan help a little.\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects\\nfor both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer\\ngraphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each\\nframe of computer animation for those films took hours to render on\\nhigh-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics\\nwould be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames\\nper second).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.\\nTrue immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual\\ndatabases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This\\nis a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot\\ntraining. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of\\nthe frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion\\nof the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system\\nmust be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex\\ndata representations.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15\\nframes per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps\\ndue to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was\\nvisible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the\\ngraphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant\\nframe rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general\\ndoes not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the\\nUNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time\\noperation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. \\nUniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time\\noperation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not\\neven SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our\\nmultiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due\\nto their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.\\n\\nFrom a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments\\nrequires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time\\nmulti-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems\\non the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2\\nsystems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly\\nimportant, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an\\nunfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop\\nVR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level.

When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a \\n          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)\\n\\n          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of \\n          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease \\n          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)\\n\\n          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this \\n          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit \\n          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)\\n\\n          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the \\n          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he \\n          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)\\n\\n     One becomes a child of God...\\n\\n          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the\\n          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)\\n\\n          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that\\n          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us\\n          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,\\n          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when\\n          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he\\n          is.

This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise\\nOED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether\\nit is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic\\nknowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally\\napplicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely\\nexplains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is\\nthe right tool for the job.\\n\\nPropositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A\\nproposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, \"It is\\nraining\" or \"Today is Tuesday\".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to\\nbe true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning\\nof \"deny\", not the everyday meaning.\\n\\nThe proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of words used to express it.  So \"God exists\" and \"There exists a\\nGod\" both express the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connected series of\\nstatements to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consists of\\nthree stages.\\n\\nFirst of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions. \\n\\nPremises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviously\" and so on.  (The phrase \"obviously\" is often viewed with\\nsuspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious\\npremises.  If something doesn\\'t seem obvious to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can always say \"Oh, yes, you\\'re right, it is obvious\" when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known\\nas inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of\\none or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further\\ninference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as \"implies that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\nis affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often\\nindicated by phrases such as \"therefore\", \"it follows that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event has a cause (premise)\\nThe universe has a beginning (premise)\\nAll beginnings involve an event (premise)\\nThis implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated \\nafterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if \\nsometimes a little confusing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or\\nconclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever\\nproducing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some\\nstatements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThis is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert\\nthe premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its \\nconclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" is not a proposition, since it is neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the\\nstatement is an argument.  If we\\'re trying to establish the truth of B, then\\nit is not an argument, it is an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- This is an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- This is an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions\\n-- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the\\nconclusion is true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\narguments, and about how probable their premises are.\\n\\nThere are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\narguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.\\n\\nIt is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does\\nnot imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insects have wings (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insects (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion is not true because the argument\\'s premises are false. \\nIf the argument\\'s premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument is thus entirely valid.\\n\\nMore subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises,\\nas in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphins are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denotes implication; \"A\" is the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respectively.\\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid arguments with sound arguments.\\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably\\nmore useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing\\nan argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.\\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs\\nas well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair\\nenough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical\\nargument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being\\nmisled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\nis often used by politicians, and can be summarized as \"might makes right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem is literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying\\nto disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or\\npeople making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.\"\\n\\nSometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by \\nshowing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness\\'s\\ntestimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person\\nargues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\'s particular circumstances.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoes?\"\\n\\nThis is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing\\nthe opponent\\'s argument.\\n\\nThis fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThis particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one\\'s\\nadversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is\\nalso known as \"poisoning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium means \"argument from ignorance\".  This fallacy\\noccurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it\\nhas not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that\\nsomething must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this\\nis not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved\\ntrue, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has\\nshown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is\\ngenerally assumed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can \\nvalidly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water,\\neven if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has\\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThis is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is \\ncommitted when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a \\nconclusion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThis is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mistaken fools?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThis fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of\\nasserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlikely it is that that proposition is correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThis line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable \\nwhether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstances mean that the rule is\\ninapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheists.\"\\n\\nThis fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThis fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one\\nforms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible cases.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a\\nparticular situation in which the features of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known as False Cause fallacies.\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the\\ncause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to\\nbe the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reasons.\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThis fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that\\nbecause two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves\\nno room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the\\nconclusion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the\\nfallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. \\nTherefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason\\nfor the British Secret Services\\' official ban on homosexual employees. \\nAnother example is the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the\\nBible is true because it is the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThis is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not\\neven been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination,\\nwhen they ask questions like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:\\n\\n\"How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument \\nsupports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the\\nteachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length\\nthat Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.\\n\\nSadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse\\nemotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different\\nmeanings in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because\\nof careless or ungrammatical phrasing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case,\\nthe meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are\\nemphasized.  For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friends\"\\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts\\nof something must apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:\\n\\n\"A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars\\nare less environmentally damaging than buses.\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nits opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a\\nproperty of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:\\n\\n\"You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThis argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevents.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThese fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way\\nsimilar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExamples:\\n\"Isn\\'t history based upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of\\nanimal based on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dogs a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, B is true, therefore A\\nis true\".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B\\nis false\".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is\\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has\\nthe form \"A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false\", where A does NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is\\ninvalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThis fallacy is an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThis is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply\\nbecause it is old, or because \"that\\'s the way it\\'s always been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThis is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of\\nasserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer\\nthan something else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or\\nmore virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThis is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the\\nmore often it is heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" is one that employs\\nconstant repetition in asserting something.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referred to as the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when\\none presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other\\nalternatives exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThis fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises\\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThis fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue\\nbeing discussed, so that everyone\\'s attention is diverted away from the\\npoints being made, towards a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is\\nthe assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else\\'s position so that it\\ncan be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a\\nfallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general\\nrule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two \\ndifferent situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a \\nclaim that those situations are analogous to each other.\\n\\nThis fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThis is the famous \"you too\" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to\\nbe acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just being randomly abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"',\n",

       "  \"[why do babies get diseases, etc.]\\n\\n Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably \\nconsistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does\\nnot support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by\\nlatest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for\\nabout 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at\\nmost) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life\\nhas been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before\\nthere were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease...\\nmostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just\\nfossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows\\nthat disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what\\nbrought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then\\nhow could it exist before humans?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about\\nbiology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There\\nis no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off'\\nin perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a\\ncollective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the\\ndegeneration of the genetic code'.\\n\\n\\n Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and\\nbacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is\\nharmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby\\nconstant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic\\nplague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But\\nit still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as\\nmuch damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even\\nwhen people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in\\nthe past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible\\ndied off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed',\\n(forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and\\ndied off for lack of nearby hosts.\\n I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few\\nhundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to\\nbe getting less nasty w/age...\\n\\n\\n Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right?\\nAnd, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It\\nseems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift\\nhumans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less\\nlethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems,\\nimperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us\\nby God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning\\nahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune\\nsystem that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made\\nour immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendents would need to fight off diseases?\\n\\n\\n Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the\\nphrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system\\nthat will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a\\nperfect system. At least, IMHO.\\n Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a\\nbunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the\\noriginal genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in\\ninferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart?\\nIf so, why could God not have used better materials?\\n Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself,\\nof did It just choose not to?\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for\\nthe explanation you give.

The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an\\noutline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <----\\nstation are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical\\nequipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit\\nprediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS\\ntracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also\\ndiscussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the\\nposition of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was\\nlaunched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <----\\nsatellite tracking video.

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna \\nMonitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 \\nwatts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement \\nand results are discussed.\\n\",\n",
       "  '-*----\\n\\nThe two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are\\nso vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael\\nSiemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution\\nof an argument over them turns on secular and cultural\\nassumptions that are independent of these rules.\\n \\n\\nThe commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,\\nin part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if\\nhe has \"ultimate responsibility.\" Indeed, many traditions present\\nan interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret\\nloving one\\'s neighbor as following various other rules, and\\nrelying on their god to make things come out right, precisely\\nbecause it would be wrong for man to assume such \"ultimate\\nresponsibility.\" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding\\ngoo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. \\n\\n\\nAnd who is to say that this interpretation is \"twisted\"?  There\\nare many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nreading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claims or base commandments to\\nshow that such readings are \"twisted,\" because this divergence in\\nunderstanding occurs even in trying to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,\\nMichael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions\\nthat these conservative Christians will reject.  \\n\\n\\nBut these base commandments are too vague to serve as  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems.\" The meaning of\\nthese base commandments for any believer derives from the secular\\nand cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how\\nthe believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of\\nother Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these things.  These commandments\\nlack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for\\ncriticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from\\nthe ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. \\n\\n\\nJesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what\\nit means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*\\nparables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are\\nstraightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline\\nepistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem is *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel \\nseriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us\\nsomething about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament\\nauthors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\nas the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and\\ngays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is\\neffective only through the extra-Christian principles through\\nwhich Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply\\nthe *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that\\nmake Michael\\'s Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paints a picture of \"standard American atheism\" as the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more\\ndamaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents\\nsuch a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by\\nan interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I\\nthink we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can\\nhave its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the\\nlukewarm we should spit out. ',\n",

       "  '\\n\\nLet us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by\\nsentence.\\n\\n\\n1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.\\n\\nOrigins of what?

It depends\\non what origins we are talking about.\\n\\n3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins\\nis to say that there is no higher truth than science.\\n\\nAgain, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of \"higher\\ntruth\" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways\\nto ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even\\nbelieve that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many\\nbelieve that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language\\nof science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither \"higher\" or \\n\"lower\"; they are simply true.\\n\\nMore to the point, restricting one\\'s discussion of origins to science\\ndoes not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the\\nscope of discussion.\\n\\n4) This is a false premise.\\n\\nIf this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false\\nthen (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another\\nfalse [or at least theologically unsound] statement.\\n\\n5) By the way, I enjoy science.\\n\\nOn the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science\\nto enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say\\nthat one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.\\nHowever one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,\\nperhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.\\n\\n6) It is truly a wonder observing God\\'s creation.\\n\\nLet us not quibble; count this one as true.\\n\\n7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent\\nreligion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]\\n\\nStill another false statement.  However one can make it come out true\\nwith the following contextual modification:\\n\\n\"Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent\\nof what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of\\nwhat Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.\"\\n\\n-----\\n\\nIt is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch\\non truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.

Matthew\\n    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on\\n    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material\\n    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).\\n\\nUS PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n\\n    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed\\n    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground\\n    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the\\n    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in\\n    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the\\n    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed\\n    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a\\n    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted\\n    from the expression \"R-dot-bar sub n\" (nth smoothed value of derivative\\n    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations\\n    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.\\n\\n    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December\\n    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a\\n    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world\\n    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide\\n    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).\\n\\n    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective\\n    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary\\n    space. Unable to collect the Sun\\'s energy for power from its solar\\n    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in\\n    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and\\n    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it\\n    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere\\n    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from\\n    this preliminary scan that Mars was a \"dead\" world in both the\\n    geological and biological sense.\\n\\n    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that\\n    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information\\n    that Venus\\' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times\\n    that of Earth\\'s, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface\\n    of an ocean.\\n\\n    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work\\n    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away\\n    the concept of Mars as a \"dead\" planet, first made from the basic\\n    measurements of MARINER 4.\\n\\n    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket\\n    launcher autopilot failed.\\n\\n    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to\\n    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no\\n    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian\\n    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once\\n    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup\\n    images of Mars\\' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.\\n\\n    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe\\n    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in\\n    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,\\n    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four\\n    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974\\n    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed\\n    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than\\n    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which\\n    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n\\n    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)\\n\\n    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph\\n    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide\\n    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new\\n    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft\\n    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on\\n    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.\\n\\n    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first\\n    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally\\n    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead\\n    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to\\n    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6\\n    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,\\n    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would\\n    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.\\n\\n    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER\\n    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to\\n    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through\\n    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever\\n    to do so.\\n\\n    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER\\n    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made\\n    the first radar studies of the planet\\'s surface via probe. PIONEER Venus\\n    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere\\n    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the\\n    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the\\n    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day\\n    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before\\n    its batteries failed.\\n\\n\\n    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)\\n\\n    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They\\n    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems\\n    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.\\n\\n    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an\\n    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the\\n    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.\\n    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the\\n    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.\\n\\n    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but\\n    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,\\n    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.\\n\\n    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost\\n    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon\\n    and drifted off into solar orbit.\\n\\n    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send\\n    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact\\n    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras\\n    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first\\n    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.\\n\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)\\n\\n    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image\\n    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO\\n    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our\\n    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.\\n    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were\\n    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.\\n    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar\\n    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.\\n\\n\\n    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)\\n\\n    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar\\n    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the\\n    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered\\n    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing\\n    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was\\n    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.\\n\\n    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the\\n    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images\\n    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from\\n    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,\\n    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored\\n    the Tycho crater region in 1968.\\n\\n\\n    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)\\n\\n    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on\\n    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June\\n    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse\\n    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for\\n    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes\\n    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of\\n    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars\\' sky was\\n    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is\\n    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the\\n    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and\\n    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.\\n\\n    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran\\n    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a\\n    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep\\n    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command\\n    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until\\n    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the\\n    engineers\\' efforts through May of 1983.\\n\\n    An interesting side note: VIKING 1\\'s lander has been designated the\\n    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the\\n    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,\\n    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until\\n    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.\\n\\n    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit\\n    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in\\n    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its\\n    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording\\n    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in\\n    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut\\n    down on April 12, 1980.\\n\\n    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.\\n\\n\\n    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)\\n\\n    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March\\n    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched\\n    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,\\n    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and\\n    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare\\n    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to\\n    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,\\n    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.\\n\\n    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their\\n    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered\\n    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and\\n    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major\\n    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous\\n    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.\\n\\n    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets\\n    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep\\n    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive\\n    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle\\n    is known). Titan\\'s atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas\\' appearance was\\n    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.\\n    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,\\n    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.\\n\\n    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,\\n    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly\\n    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was\\n    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational\\n    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on\\n    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10\\n    satellites and one more ring were discovered.\\n\\n    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,\\n    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright\\n    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were\\n    discovered. Neptune\\'s magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a\\n    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What\\'s liquid at 38K?)\\n\\n    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their\\n    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets\\n    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the\\n    location of the heliopause.\\n\\n\\nSOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and\\n    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES\\n\\n    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first\\n\\t     craft in solar orbit.\\n    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.\\n    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.\\n    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3.

Returned soil samples in\\n\\t      1976.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET VENUS PROBES\\n\\n    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions\\n\\t       lost enroute in 1961.\\n    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with\\n\\t       VENERA 3.

No images were returned.\\n    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.\\n\\t       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe\\n\\t       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.\\n    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending\\n\\t       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before\\n\\t       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles\\n\\t       similar in 1969.\\n    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet\\n\\t       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in\\n\\t       1972.\\n    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the\\n\\t       first probe to orbit Venus.

Flyby buses went on\\n\\t     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in\\n\\t     March of 1986.\\n\\n\\n    SOVIET MARS PROBES\\n\\n    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased\\n\\t     enroute the following year.\\n    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.\\n    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian\\n\\t     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red\\n\\t     Planet in 1971.\\n    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander\\n\\t     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.\\n    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to\\n\\t     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.\\n    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in\\n\\t     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.\\n\\t     probe MARINER 9.\\n    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.\\n    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit\\n\\t     with its flyby bus.\\n    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars\\' largest\\n\\t       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to\\n\\t       human/computer error.\\n    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did\\n\\t       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week\\n\\t       before scheduled Phobos landing.\\n\\n    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even\\n    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have\\n    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,\\n    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a\\n    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been\\n    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now\\n    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their\\n    space program remains to be seen.\\n\\n\\nJAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS\\n\\n    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on\\n    January 8 1985, and approached Halley\\'s Comet within about 7 million km\\n    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to\\n    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of\\n    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on\\n    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth\\'s. The closest\\n    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The\\n    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for\\n    a Japanese spacecraft.\\n\\n    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail\\n    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby\\n    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth\\'s radius)), and the third\\n    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).\\n\\n\\n    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,\\n    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten\\n    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first\\n    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget\\n    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to\\n    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.\\n\\n    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An\\n    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists\\n    to lose track of it. Hagoromo\\'s rocket motor fired on schedule on March\\n    19, but the spacecraft\\'s tracking transmitter failed immediately. The\\n    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt\\n    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.\\n\\n    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and\\n    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth\\'s atmosphere. Hiten\\n    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,\\n    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon\\'s surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and\\n    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into\\n    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the\\n    approach:\\n\\n\\tApoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km\\n\\tPeriapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km\\n\\tInclination\\t: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)\\n\\tPeriod\\t\\t: 4.7 days\\n\\n\\nPLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES\\n\\n    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three\\n    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,\\n    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means\\n    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your\\n    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can\\n    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.\\n\\n    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it\\n    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in\\n    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in\\n    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date\\n    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra\\n    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good\\n    public and university library.

Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,\\n    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.\\n\\n    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration.

They still arm themselves to \"defend the\\n#>faith\", and stockpile food as well.  They have been involved in quite a\\n#>lot of illegal activity - including multiple (and often underage) wives\\n#>for the leaders - a practice still in vogue with some splinters of their\\n#>sect.  The parallels between Koresh and Joseph Smith are striking.\\n#                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nBy \"they,\" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when\\nJoseph Smith was still alive, plenty of \"accusations\" were filed, most of\\nwhich had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.\\nI have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove\\nthat the lds leadership was involved, in quote: \"illegal activities.\"\\nPlural marriage, yes, but your charge of \"underage\" wives sounds like it\\ncould have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral\\nstandards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it\\nappears, those of David Koresh.\\n\\n#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram\\n#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over\\n#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like\\n#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider\\n#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I\\'m led to understand.  Make\\n#no mistake, this was no messiah we\\'re talking about in Smith).  The\\n\\nAnd neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral\\naptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have\\nnothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only \"crime\"\\nwas that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried\\nto explain the \"Smith phenomenon\" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5\\nmillion member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith\\'s\\ntestimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.\\n\\n#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed\\n#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only\\n#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have\\n#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The\\n#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn\\'t of much help\\n#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.\\n#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited\\n#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other\\n#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)\\n\\n\"The rest\" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,\\nwhile the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various\\nauxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new\\nprophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and\\ndoctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in\\nline to fill the prophet Joseph Smith\\'s vacancy: he was the senior\\napostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated\\nthat it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.\\n\\nOther rightful \"heirs\" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated\\n(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,\\nJoseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty\\nland beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This\\n\"Rekhabite\" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated\\nby the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.\\n\\nGranted, a couple of \"do-it-yourselfers\" stayed behind, unwilling to\\nsacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but\\nthis also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The\\nchurch benefitted from this purification process: they became even\\nmore unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.\\n\\n#        Both sects practiced the \"1-year food stockpile\" doctrine,\\n#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at\\n#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a\\n#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than\\n#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a\\n#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite\\n#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,\\n#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people\\n#had nobody to turn to save themselves.\\n#\\n#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.\\n\\nBTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of\\nthe largest denominations in the country) a \"sect\"???  It didn\\'t \"splinter\"\\nfrom any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.\\n\\n#>So what did the Mormons get?  It seems that J. Edgar Hoover was very\\n#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They\\'re pledged to defend\\n#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually\\n#>do - even to the point of suicide.)\\n\\nWhat a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am\\nnot comfortable with this alleged \"cosiness\" with Mammon: I assure you\\nthat *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our\\nONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has\\nappointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about\\nsuicide and \"atone for sins with blood\") is yet another insulting\\nmisrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...\\n\\n#\\n#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS\\n#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts\\n#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have\\n#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I\\'m taking it with a salt block.\\n\\nMake it a really big salt mountain with a glacier on top.\\n\\n#>  So he hired virtually no one but\\n#>Mormons, until the FBI was almost exclusively staffed by members of the\\n#>Church of Later Day Saints.  Though J. Edgar is finally gone, the FBI\\n#>personnel (especially the field agents) are still heavily Mormon.\\n#>I have often wondered how this might affect the FBI\\'s treatment\\n#>of religious organizations a Mormon would consider heretical.\\n\\nPreposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I\\nam convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes\\nof honor and conduct (that\\'s why they were selected for in the\\nfirst place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith\\nSTRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all\\npeople are free to worship \"*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.\"\\n\\n#        If it\\'s true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS\\n#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true\\n#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his\\n#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may\\n#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You\\n#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected\\n#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to\\n#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they\\n#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover\\n#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade\\n#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.\\n#These people are the \"salt of the Earth\" and as such are more\\n#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.\\n\\nA good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people\\nare sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon\\'s \"orders\" (the late\\npresident Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong\\nopposition of the selection of the MX \"Peace Keeper\" missile maze\\nin Utah).\\n\\n#        That\\'s my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have\\n#splinter groups that don\\'t mirror the masses, but these are small\\n#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.\\n#\\n#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a\\n#man\\'s religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with\\n#the weapons suitable for the job, he\\'ll find an ally in me.\\n#\\n#< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\\n#<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The\\nscientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds\\nand is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.\\n\\n     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA\\'s Upper\\nAtmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements\\nProgram.

       "  'I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or\\nTrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted\\nby a 3D scanline renderer. \\n\\nI have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but\\nhave never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have\\nsome of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to\\nturn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple\\npolygons). For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outlines:\\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a \"polygon with\\nholes\". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.\\n\\nI do not want to use this simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy fonts).\\n\\t2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.\\n\\nFrom my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as\\nis done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal\\npolygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into\\npolgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution\\nsince it creates excess number of polygons.\\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create\\nbevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines?

He is accusing everyone.\\nMe, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one\\nsees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with \\nwhether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  \\n\\nJesus uses the word \"men\".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.\\nJesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.\\nChristians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian \\nis just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian \\ncan see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought\\nout into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been\\nexposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven\\'t\\nseen Jesus\\'s light, your evil deeds simply haven\\'t been\\nexposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your\\nown.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the\\nHoly Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can\\nshine light into places inside us where we didn\\'t even know\\nexisted. \\n\\nSo do you see Jesus\\'s point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians\\nare not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the\\nLight of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,\\nand they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far\\nwe have fallen from Jesus\\'s perspective.  Do you think you want to\\nknow how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants\\nto know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,\\nwhich do you choose?\\n\\n\\nAnd I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, \\nwho made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part\\nof his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who\\ndied with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was\\ntheir downfall to death. \\n\\nAnd Kent, don\\'t you bury yourself underneath a rock with an\\nexcuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.\\nDavid Koresh was no light and no excuse for\\nyou to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who\\nclaimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh\\nwas born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn\\'t\\neven a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.\\n\\nJesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David\\nKoresh wasn\\'t anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be\\naware of imposters 2000 years ago.  \\n\\nSo the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to\\nbe Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your\\nmother\\'s name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that\\nsimple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar\\nright from the start.  The wouldn\\'t have followed Koresh.\\nThey wouldn\\'t have died.  But look what happened.  Their\\nignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant\\ncost them a lot.\\n\\nKent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you\\nnot remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  \\nDid not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you\\nremember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt\\nEve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, \\nwas the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus\\'s case,\\nJesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It\\ndidn\\'t work with Jesus.  \\n\\nDoes what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan\\ntried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what\\nKoresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?\\nWho was Koresh\\'s teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what\\nSatan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did\\nnot Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not\\nthe cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew\\nthe real Christ was born in Bethlehem?

Good and\\nevil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.\\n\\nThe Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of\\nbeing. The warring opposites within us are a product of man\\'s\\nrebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of\\nthe Scriptures.\\n\\nMan was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words\\nof St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was\\nthat God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the\\nEastern Orthodox Church, this is called \"theosis,\" or \"deification.\"\\n\\nOne can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,\\nand body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture\\nof the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs\\nwas a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the\\nCreator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,\\ntheir natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly\\nirreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in\\ntheir lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This\\nis symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.\\n\\nThe beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it\\nwere to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,\\nits paradisiac state would also be destroyed.\\n\\nWas it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of\\ninnocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining\\nof self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His\\nmasterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?\\n\\nGod must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral\\nvalue, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There\\nis no other way to achieve union with God.\\n\\nJesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.\\nHe was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,\\nand making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,\\nnot in His essence, but in His energies.\\n\\nThe opposites is THE Christian problem.

(Due to the prevailing assumption \\nthat the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)\\n\\n  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the \\ndevelopment of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications \\nof BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!\\n\\n  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!\\n\\n  \\n1\\n  I dream like this: ether based reality\\n \\n  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations \\nstart as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices\\nboth drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, \\nconverting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. \\n(non-spinning lattice = \"dark matter\")\\n\\n  The earth isn\\'t exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image \\nof a galaxy; we haven\\'t any videos of them spinning. Picture us \\nbeing stationary, and the sun\\'s image being dragged across the sky by \\nthe spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is \\nspinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner \\nkernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a \\nfaster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground \\nof the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but \\nits \"foot print\" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])\\n  \\n  The moon isn\\'t exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self \\nspin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth\\'s ether field, which is \\nitself in the sun\\'s much more powerful field. Our seasons are the \\nwobble of earth\\'s axis, like a top slowing down. The \"orbit\" of the\\nearth around the sun is all of the stars\\' images being dragged around\\nby the sun\\'s ether feild.\\n\\n  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and \"distance\" \\napart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because \\nthe \"path\" is not the same. The moon\\'s lattice in the ether is like \\nsticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half \\nturn. The sun\\'s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has \\ngot the whole plate of noodles wound up.

Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, \\nwould you guess that they are about the same size, just because they \\nlook about the same size?\\n\\n   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S\\n E       /     \\\\            \\n    M    |      |      OR                M    \\n         \\\\ _ _ /                         \\n       S                           \\n       \\n  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate\\nof ether spins.

No matter where it is, the light part is \\nthe part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away \\nfrom the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.\\n\\n  \"Light-Years\" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is \\ncloser to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase \\nof reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. \\n(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be \\nessentially happening now. The \"piece\" of light may have experienced \\nmany years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.\\n\\n  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to \\nde-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design \\na propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like \\ntrying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)\\n\\n  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I\\'d \\nlook in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just \\nmight carry decipherable data. I\\'d start looking on some part of the \\nspectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise.

The dark one was in the process of making the \\nothers into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by \\n\"advising\" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into \\nreproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that \\nthe little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to \\nprovide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it \\nin his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his \\ncontrol. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying \\nthat there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve \\nsouls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was \\nfinite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in \\nour reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it \\nseemed odd, but we couldn\\'t remember how else it should be. Then \\nsome of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no \\nmore, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped \\nthrough his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that \\nhe had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, \\nexisting only on the wind. \\n\\n  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls \\nwhose will\\'s are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat \\nothers as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a \\nlonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for \\nplaymates. (its not eternal, there\\'s more than one way back) \\n\\n Accepting rides to the past:\\nOnce here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a \\nPrince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go \\nahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. \\nI Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes \\nyour work, but thinks you\\'re getting wise, he can direct you to cross \\npaths with your old self, and you\\'ll vanish as you rewrite your own \\ncourse of history, none the wiser.\\n\\n  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped \\nback in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still \\nmake changes while he\\'s here, its just that that is work, and with \\nevery \\'adjustment\\', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which \\nloosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. \\nBut he can\\'t see the change.

I don\\'t think his arguments warrant the use of a \"Therefore...\"\\n\\n\\nThis is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with\\npeople result in - quoting the bible.

       "  '\\n\\nI think the passage you\\'re looking for is the following.\\n\\nMatthew 5:17    \"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the \\nprophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. \\nMatthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, \\nnot an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. \\nMatthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments \\nand teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he \\nwho does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of \\nheaven. \\nMatthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of \\nthe scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. \\n\\nThere are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the\\nLaw was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but\\nnot on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human\\nbeings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesus\\' death was what to do\\nabout Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law was abolished.  It\\nsimply acknowledged that fact that it didn\\'t apply to Gentiles.  This\\nis a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded\\nin Acts 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\'s more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul\\'s apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus\\' commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a\\npurpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this\\nissue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his\\ndiscussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and\\nassures us that that\\'s not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees\\nthe Law as primarily being present to convict people of their\\nsinfulness.  But ultimately it\\'s an impossible standard, and one that\\nhas been superceded by Christ.  Paul\\'s comments are not the world\\'s\\nclearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the\\ninteresting thing to notice is that even this radical position does\\nnot entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an\\nuncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.\\nFor its purpose of convicting of sin, it\\'s important that it not be\\nrelaxed.  However for Christians, it\\'s not the end -- ultimately we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal reading,\\nbut in fact that\\'s not Jesus\\' approach.  Jesus\\' interpretations\\nemphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetails.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude\\ntowards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a\\ntenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that\\nreally matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and\\nplates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the\\nLaw in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.\\nPaul\\'s conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite\\nconcerned about maintaining moral standards.\\n\\nThe net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being\\nsuperceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe\\nthey are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is\\nembroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters\\nresponding to specific situations, he\\'s looking at the aspect of the\\nLaw that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish\\nceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards\\nof conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems\\nto be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and\\nhuman relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later\\nto give Paul so much trouble.',\n",

Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying  \\nI BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even \\nafter reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.\\n\\nBut first let me say the following.\\nWe might have a language problem here - in regards to \"faith\" and\\n\"existence\". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist.\\nTo exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE\\nbeing - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not\\nexist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it\\'s rather pointless\\nto debate the so called \"existence\" of God - and that is not what\\nI\\'m doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of\\nbeing. When you say that \"god does not exist\", I also accept this\\nstatement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However,\\nin what follows I will use the phrase \"the existence of God\" in it\\'s\\n\\'usual sense\\' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it.\\nI would like a clarification upon what you mean by \"the existence of\\nGod\".\\n \\nWe also might differ upon what it means to have faith.

When you say\\nthat you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion\\n\"based upon observation\", I will have to ask \"what observtions are\\nyou refering to?\" There are NO observations - pro or con - that\\nare valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations\\ncan only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even\\nbe predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes \\npartents \"believe in God\" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion\\nabout the \"existence\" or \"non-existence\" of God requires a leap - and\\nyou have made this leap when you actively say \"I believe that God  \\ndoes/does not exist\". Personally, I think that both statements are\\nmisguided. Arguing over the \"existence\" of God is precisely the wrong way\\nto find Him (and yes, I use \"Him\" because a personal God is the only \\nviable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use \"She\" go ahead.

And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is\\nindeed \"chorion.\" \\n\\nNow I\\'ve checked several Greek-English lexicons:\\n\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robinson\\'s Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament\"\\n\\t\"Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word study Concordance,\" Tynsdale\\n\\t\"A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other \\n\\t early Christian Writings,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Perschbacher\\n\\nIn each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:\\n\\n\\tA space, place, region, district, field, area, \"country place,\" \\n\\tland, farm, estate, \"a bit of tillage\", and similar meanings.\\n\\nNowhere do any of these books mention anything about \"grave.\" As some of these \\nbooks go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books \\nare all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I \\nthink it more likely that Mr Archer\\'s investigations into \"contradictions\" to \\nbe once again, as your friend said it, \"lacking in substance,\" and thus Archer \\nis again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would \\nhave honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them\\nto support Mr Archer\\'s contentions). \\n\\nBy the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson\\'s) is the definition of\\n\"agros,\" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word\\n\"agros\" is defined as \"a field in the country.\" Chorion is specifically noted\\nas a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly\\nBullinger\\'s exegisis was, which stated that the word for \"field\" in Matthew\\n(ie: agros) is different from the word for \"field\" in Acts (ie: chorion), and\\nthus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already\\nadmit how stupid Bullinger\\'s exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity\\nwhich drives the point home). \\n\\nSo as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise\\n(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this \\nparticular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer\\nquestions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and \\nthe fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in\\ndiscussing the \"Potter\\'s Field.\"\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler',\n",

When work for a large program like\\n   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the\\n   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts\\n   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the\\n   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to\\n   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about\\n   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10\\n   billion won\\'t be spent on anything having anything\\n   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion\\n   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn\\'t), but the work done\\n   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting\\n   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the\\n   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the\\n   term \\'center tax\\'. They look at the Station they are\\n   getting and the price they are paying and note that\\n   it doesn\\'t add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware\\n   that a third of the money is going for something else.\"\\n\\nMy dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple\\nof weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I\\ntalked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station\\nat Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn\\'t post a\\nresponse immediately, I do have a real job I\\'m supposed\\nto be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz\\ndata & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low\\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\\nin Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers \\nAssociation conference, extolling the virtues of SSF\\nto 15,000 science teachers.]\\n\\nFirst off, yes, the concept of \\'center tax\\', or \\'wrap\\' does\\nexist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total \\'tax\\'\\nfor the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.\\nThis was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\\ncenter \\'taxes\\'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at\\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is\\n04/2.2 = 1.8%\\n\\nOver the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30\\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to\\n$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I\\nwill concede it\\'s still an appreciable amount of pocket\\nchange.\\n\\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds\\nthat are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some\\nstates, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat\\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\\'t if you get it\\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds\\nwe receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\\nsubject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the numbers in\\nfront of me, but I\\'d guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds\\ngo to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\'s only applied to funds spent at the\\ncenter, and not to the prime contracts.\\n\\nThis leads to the obvious question \"What is the government\\ndoing with SSF funds that don\\'t go to the prime contractors?\\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\\nbig portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens\\nto the balance of the funds, which aren\\'t eaten\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\n\\nAt WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting\\ndevelopment funds (as they are supporting the development\\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to\\nsetup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical\\npower system architecture. Our testbed has a real life\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\nresearch a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries\\n(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC\\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated\\nloads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent\\nchange evaluation involving concerns about the stability\\nof the power system.\\n\\nWe have also used the supporting development money to\\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life\\ntesting at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in\\nIndiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on\\ntest recently hit the four year life test milestone.\\n38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the\\non-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).\\n\\nAs a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewis used\\nthe supporting development funds to purchase personal\\ncomputers and work stations, for performing system\\nanalyses (like modeling of the performance of the\\nelectrical power system, availability calculations\\nusing a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a \\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\nsystem elements).\\n\\nFinally, the money raised by the \\'tax\\' does not all\\ngo into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewis, the director\\ndoes control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\\nany individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to\\nthe director to get money from this fund to look\\nat pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.\\n\\nMost of the tax, however, goes to fund the \\'general\\'\\nservices at the Center, like the library, the \\ncentral computer services division, the Contractor \\nwho removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\nSSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activities. To get\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\nand then divide by the amount of the library funds\\nused to support SSF (which would be hard to\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\\n1 year is \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on\\nthe person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week\\nversus the rest of the center personnel). You would\\nthen have to compare this estimate of the SSF\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\nthe tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,\\nmaybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but\\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\\na burecratic nightmare!',\n",

Leverrier made an extensive set of observations\\nand calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later\\nimproved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier\\'s system\\nof equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune\\nand since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit\\nof Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was\\nafoot with Mercury.\\n\\nBut alas, \\'twere not so.  Mercury\\'s perihelion precesses at the rate\\nit does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly\\ncurved due to the sun\\'s mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915\\nand Albert Einstein\\'s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics\\nof moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian \\ngeometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of\\nit\\'s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession\\nof Mercury\\'s perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb\\'s\\nnumbers rather than Leverrier\\'s.)\\n\\nOf course not everybody believes Einstein, and that\\'s fine.  But subsequent\\nefforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar\\nhave been fruitless.\\n\\n-Bill Gawne\\n\\n \"Forgive him, he is a barbarian, who thinks the customs of his tribe\\n  are the laws of the universe.\"                       - G.

Why do I say this?\\nBecause by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which\\nyou write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are\\nattempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.\\nYours doesn\\'t at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn\\'t come to you\\nbecause your god doesn\\'t exist.\\n\\n\\nI am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.\\nWhat I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.\\n\\n\\nBe true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain \\nknowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the\\nBible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and\\nthere exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond\\nour shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  \\nto seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a\\nperson who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find \\nsomething to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one\\nwill gain with that attitude is folly.\\n\\nBe careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages\\nin the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even\\nthough they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.\\nBe assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such\\ndeep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. \\nI will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, \"You will never\\nbe thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.\"\\n\\n\\nFrom King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):\\n\\n    \"It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;\\n     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.\"\\n\\n\\nJesus says in John 6:44 & 55:\\n\\n   \"No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.\"\\n\\n\\nAnd in John 3:16:\\n\\n   \"For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,\\n   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal\\n   life.\"\\n\\n\\nYou are included in \"whosoever\".  And I also pray that the Father is\\ndrawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn\\'t be posting\\nto talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the\\nmaking.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure\\nstoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became\\non of the most celebrated men in the history of God\\'s church.\\n\\nYou see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because\\nyou could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack\\nChristians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,\\nproclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.\\n\\nOr you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would \\nprobably say to you: \"Satan would surely like to have you.\"  Why so?\\nBecause Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great\\nmoments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task\\nhe did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the\\nfaith to walk on water as Jesus did.\\n\\nYou asked \"Why not believe in Zeus?\"  Zeus didn\\'t offer eternal life.\\nYou got nothing to gain by believing in Zeus.\\n',\n",

(THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE \\n          UNIVERSES.)                             \\n\\n               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and \\n          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from \\n          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed \\n          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly \\n          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. \\n      \\n               And emotional \"feelings\" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING \\n          indicator for religious validity. \\n    \\n               These things are similarly true for followers of most \\n          other major world religions, including Islam. \\n     \\n               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune \\n          His Initiates into the \"AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\" or \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\", (referred to as \"THE WORD\" in John 1:1-5, and as \\n          \"The River of Life\" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally \\n          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they \\n          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a \\n          \"silver cord\". \\n    \\n               True Salvation, which completes a Soul\\'s cycles of \\n          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved \\n          only by reaching at least the \"SOUL PLANE\", which is five \\n          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this \\n          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri \\n          Harold Klemp, the Living \"Eck\" Master or \"Mahanta\" for the \\n          \"Eckankar\" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, \\n          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). \\n    \\n               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now \\n          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the \"Sant \\n          Mat\" organization. \\n      \\n               One of the classic books on this subject is \"THE PATH OF \\n          THE MASTERS\" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  \\n          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian \\n          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India \\n          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of \\n          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. \\n    \\n               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored \\n          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in \\n          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or \\n          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book \"ECKANKAR--THE \\n          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER \\n          classic. \\n    \\n               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with \\n          the \"Anti-Christ\", which is or was to be a temporary world \\n          dictator during the so-called \"last days\".  But the Masters \\n          don\\'t ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as \\n          Jesus was. \\n    \\n               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or \\n          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will \\n          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the \\n          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they \\n          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine \\n          Master. \\n    \\n          \\n    \\n          RE-INCARNATION\\n          \\n               The book \"HERE AND HEREAFTER\", by Ruth Montgomery, \\n          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation \\n          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past \\n          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes \\n          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], \\n          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of \\n          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, \\n          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-\\n          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-\\n          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-\\n          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS \\n          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the \\n          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How \\n          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED \\n          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the \"KING JAMES VERSION\".  Later \\n          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] \\n          \\n               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., \\n          typically originate from a person\\'s PAST LIVES.  For example, \\n          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually \\n          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  \\n          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to \\n          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, \\n          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS \\n          INCARNATION. \\n\\n               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF \\n          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would \\n          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their \\n          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the \\n          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! \\n\\n\\n\\n          \"2nd COMINGS\"\\n\\n               If a Divine Master physically dies (\"translates\") \\n          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that \\n          Initiate physically dies (\"translates\"), the Master will meet \\n          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul \\n          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd \\n          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that \\n          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still \\n          waiting for Jesus\\' \"2nd Coming\" are WAITING IN VAIN. \\n    \\n          \\n          \\n          PLANES OF EXISTENCE\\n\\n               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN \\n          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the \\n          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric \\n          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), \\n          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The \\n          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from \\n          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the \\n          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. \\n    \\n               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological \\n          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See \\n          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without \\n          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between \\n          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. \\n    \\n               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a \\n          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called \"Hades\", and the \\n          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there \\n          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some \\n          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a \\n          THREATENING manner.  The Christian \"Heaven\" is located \\n          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there \\n          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH\\n\\n               The Christian religion demands of its followers an \\n          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more \\n          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). \\n       \\n               If a person is not HEARING some form of the \"SOUND \\n          CURRENT\" (\"THE WORD\", \"THE BANI\", \"THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM\"), \\n          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL \\n          CONTINUE. \\n    \\n               The \"SOUND CURRENT\" manifests differently for different \\n          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on \\n          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a \\n          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, \\n          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as \\n          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as \"SOUL TRAVEL\") \\n          REPLACE blind faith. \\n    \\n\\n\\n               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., \\n          please consult my CITED SOURCES (3 books, 2 addresses). \\n\\n\\n\\n               UN-altered REPRODUCTION and DISSEMINATION of this \\n          IMPORTANT Information is ENCOURAGED. \\n',\n",

       "  '\\nThe number of civilian Iraqi deaths were way over-exaggerated and \\nexploited for anti-war emotionalism by the liberal news media.  The\\nfacts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians \\nin any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly\\nto the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques\\nwhich were technically possible only recently.\\n\\nThe idea that \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi citizens died is\\nludicrous.  Not even \"hundreds of thousands\" of Iraqi soldiers died,\\nand they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US\\nand its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians?\\nEither the smart bombs didn\\'t hit their targets (and we know they did),\\nor they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to\\ndestroying Iraq\\'s military potential.  The military mission planners are\\nnot fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war.\\nHitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you,\\nnot a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their\\ntyrant-dictator. \\n\\nHow about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2?\\nI don\\'t hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but\\nwith smart bombs, it\\'s becoming more exact with a smaller percentage\\nof civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are\\nmisidentified; innocents die.  That\\'s war the way it really is.\\nBut the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth\\nlike it\\'s one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is\\nworse.  Like Patrick Henry said some 217 years ago, \"I know not what\\ncourse others may take -- but as for me, give me liberty, or give me\\ndeath!\"  War is always the price one must be willing to pay if one\\nwishes to stay free.   \\n\\n\\nMathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here.\\nYou come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I\\nfeel sure that was not your intent.\\n\\nSo the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nworked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \\nFrench who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We \\nshould have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you\\'d be speaking\\nGerman instead of English right now.\\n\\nTyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don\\'t understand\\ndiplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is\\nthat Bush wimped out and didn\\'t have the military roll into Baghdad, so\\nnow Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people\\'s sacrifice (not to\\nmention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait \\nwas a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would\\'ve been better!\\n\\nAnd as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why*\\nthe jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of \"not guilty\"?\\nThose who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those\\npolicemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape.\\nBut the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I\\nhave not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a\\ntrial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply\\nlowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind\\nwhich your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends\\nto support in the case against the policemen.  \\n\\nLaw in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused,\\nwhether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is\\na reasonable doubt of one\\'s guilt, and only the jury is in a position\\nto assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply\\nsuccumbing to verbal vigilantism.\\n       \\nRegards,',\n",

       "  '\\nStop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that \\nthe first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi \\nparty, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red\\nherring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of \\nthe histories I\\'ve read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using \\nhomosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that\\nHitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse\\nofficial history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts\\nright. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of\\nhomosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it\\nis possible that the histories I\\'ve read have not mentioned this, but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\'s best interest to admit to the world that his\\nformer right hand man was a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references \\nto the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even \\nthe Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, \\nthis does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the \\n1920\\'s.\\n\\n\\nAh, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the\\nparanoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with \\nhomosexuality (at least, not according to what I\\'ve read), I\\'d like to know \\nwhat tainted \"evidence\" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made \\nby persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the \\n1920\\'s and 30\\'s, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in \\ntime and plant \"tainted\" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers \\nwhich were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being \\nobvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in \\nthese matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof \\nfalls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework \\nbefore making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.\\n\\n\\nThis is just about the *only* thing we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhis SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling\\nseems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this\\nmust be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what\\nlies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this\\nis not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If \\nyou really think that historians are so incompetent, why don\\'t you write them \\nand ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can\\'t tell from \\ntheir footnotes? I\\'m a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and\\ntracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my\\nspecialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would\\ncast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I\\'m not going to waste my time\\ntrying to debunk someone\\'s paranoia. Do the research yourself.\\n\\n\\nGiven that you already consider all evidence \"tainted\", what on earth would\\nconstitute concrete particulars?

Mitchell\\n                          March 23, 1993\\n \\nINTRODUCTION:\\n \\nIn order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a\\nreal miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test\\ntele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals\\nlocated world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment\\npurposes.\\nNot only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of\\ninformation\\non methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating\\neducational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and\\nachievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learning methods.\\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests\\nand\\nskills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,\\ninterfacing\\nand electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving\\nplayground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and\\nprofessionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real\\nfacility\\nexists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested\\nby the users themselves.\\n \\nThis has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:\\n - tele-operations and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers\\n - art and theater\\n - bbs and online network users\\n - software and game developers\\n - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains\\n - children\\n - the child in all of us\\n \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used\\nfor murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions\\nis hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and\\nmachine-lets.\\n \\n The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:\\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on\\n it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture\\n content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent\\n to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.\\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains\\nwith TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control\\nelectronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a\\nservo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped\\nbulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators\\nworldwide\\nto receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and\\ntakeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on\\ncommercially\\navailable items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the\\ninterface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced\\nham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.\\n \\nBy taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding\\na tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be\\nprovided in under 80 man hours.\\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by\\nproviding a host computer network and Internet access to that network.\\nDiaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be\\nmodified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.\\nAn initial \"ground breaking\" with miniature shovels will be performed for\\na live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodels will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for\\nhistorical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely\\nserious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional\\nbuilding, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and\\nthe photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online networks and bbs\\'s. A press release will be\\nissued\\ncalling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale\\nmodels\\nfor the simulated lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to\\nfind instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that\\ntime\\nthe results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return\\nto\\ntheir campus.\\n \\nA monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via\\nconventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment\\naddition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.\\nHaving a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especially since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be\\ninvited to issue \"challenges\" to engineering and human factors students at\\nuniversities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform\\nlunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.\\n \\nThe long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited\\nto space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!\\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has\\never enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a\\nglobally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people\\'s minds in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTERS:\\n \\n\"Illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe following people are already engaged in various parts of this work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

The philosophy of\\nReston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are\\ncompletely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There\\nis no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project\\nthat it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for \\nApollo?\\n\\n\\nOh you are full of it Allen on this one.

Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what\\nthey want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. \\n\\n\\nI agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful\\nlarge scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that\\nintegration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called\\nleadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for\\nthe success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership\\nand responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up\\nas Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC\\nand they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to\\nfinally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the\\nprocess then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.\\n\\nThere is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that\\nfor a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the\\nturn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is\\nlack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of\\nleadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a\\nsymptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your\\nefforts that you do not see this.\\n\\n\\nNo, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have \\nhappened in the first place.\\n\\nI have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is\\nat reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally\\nignoring the lack of leadership of congress.

The fuel was recovered after 5 months\\n    with no release of plutonium.

Studies\\n    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in\\n    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The\\n    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted\\n    study, Charles Jackman.\\n\\n    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the\\n    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was\\n    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space\\n    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia\\n    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space\\n    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and\\n    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects\\n    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.\\n\\n    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:\\n\\n       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year\\n\\t  Shuttle sources:\\t  725,000 kilograms/year\\n\\n    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are\\n    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the\\n    total stratospheric chlorine sources.\\n\\n    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would\\n    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability\\n    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.\\n\\n    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed\\n    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally\\n    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and\\n    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch\\n    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be\\n    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about\\n    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons\\n    do at the present time.\\n\\n    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR\\n    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W.

Holding your\\n    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to\\n    watch out for when ascending, and you\\'ll have eardrum trouble if your\\n    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal\\n    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no\\n    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do\\n    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.\\n\\n    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly \"the bends\", certainly some\\n    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)\\n    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from\\n    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,\\n    you\\'re dying. The limits are not really known.\\n\\n    References:\\n\\n    _The Effect on the Chimpanzee of Rapid Decompression to a Near Vacuum_,\\n    Alfred G.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School\\n    of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.\\n\\n\\n    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED\\n\\n    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is\\n    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.\\n    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank\\n    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the\\n    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin\\n    team\\'s medical/forensic report.\\n\\n    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the\\n    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks\\n    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team\\n    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.\\n\\n\\n    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT\\n\\n    You can\\'t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit\\n    because it can\\'t get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry\\n    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.\\n\\n    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of\\n    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in\\n    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly\\n    specialized for travel between Earth\\'s surface and low orbit. Taking it\\n    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would\\n    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit\\n    spacecraft.\\n\\n    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]\\n\\n\\n    THE \"FACE ON MARS\"\\n\\n    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid\\n    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:\\n    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often\\n    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13\\n    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).\\n\\n    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is\\n    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an\\n    extraterrestrial civilization.

Other Viking images show a\\n    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere\\n    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don\\'t\\n    know the address) to study the Face.\\n\\n    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution\\n    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this\\n    question in a few years.

An atheist\\n doesn\\'t have to hold the positive view that god doesn\\'t exist, he/she may\\n just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here\\'s the example:\\n \\n Strong atheism - \"I believe god does not exist\"   a positive belief\\n\\n Weak atheism   - \"I don\\'t believe in a god\"       a negative belief\\n \\n these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of\\n god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that\\n you are calling unreasonable.  Or let\\'s look at it this way (in sets)\\n \\n suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent\\n as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas\\n exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person\\n not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that\\n even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!

An atheist is one for whom all things can\\nbe understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need\\nfor any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is\\nno purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by\\nphysics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is\\ndetermnined.\\nThis would also have to include human intelligence of course and all\\nits products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it\\nacquire intelligence, it\\'s just a happy accident. For an atheist, no\\nevent can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less\\nvalue than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about-\\nan event can have value. \\nThe products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment,\\nfrom teaching, training, observation and experience and are only\\nsignificant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental\\nprocesses and the images they produce for us are just electrical\\nactivity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human\\nmind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a\\nhill.\\nHow then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing\\nthe values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On\\nwhat grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It\\nseems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you\\nhave to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what\\nin nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to\\nestablish your values.\\nSince every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what\\ndifference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or\\notherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only\\nway an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the\\nobjection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn\\'t like it\\n- that\\'s it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer\\nthat it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries\\nno weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\nThat you don\\'t like what God told people to do says nothing about God\\nor God\\'s commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your\\nnervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled\\nwith a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your\\nobjections -seem- well founded is due to the way you\\'ve been\\nconditioned; there is no \"truth\" content. The whole of your\\nintellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.\\nI didn\\'t make these rules, it\\'s inherent in naturalistic atheism and\\nto be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human\\nthought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded\\nyourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil,\\netc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no\\nweight whatsoever.',\n",

       "  \"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly\\nhad with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  This is how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,\\nI called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.\\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,\\nwho scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not\\nbozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking\\nto him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.\\nWe covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  \\nMost of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another\\nwoman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate\\naligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming \\nfeasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism\\npaper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the\\natmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is \\nmore pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education \\nwhereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other\\nfields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.\\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business\\nangle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal\\ncommunicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided\\nin those sectors.\\n\\nJobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.\\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order\\nto make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.\\n\\nWe ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are\\nproceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresults from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along\\nthe lines of lowering the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.\\nHe asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually\\nhappen immediatly there.\\n\\nThe last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know\\nthe answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who\\nreally did know the answers.\\n\\nThen finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this\\nwould be something that she would be very interested in, although they\\ndo have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these days.\\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\",\n",

SGI is committed to high\\nperformance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL\\nmeans that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no\\nguarantee that your performance would be comparable.\\n\\n\\nIf your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a\\nvalid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI\\nsales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we\\nunderstand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a\\nshot.\\n\\n\\nAs one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in\\n1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates\\nsped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5\\nyears. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI\\n('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power\\nSeries parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a\\nparticular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics\\narchitectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every\\n18 months to 2 years.\\n\\nThese are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become\\nalmost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new\\nplatform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,\\nfaster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we\\ndon't, we become uncompetitive.\\n\\nFrom the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your\\ncurrent needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but\\nif you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep\\nfor one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some\\nof our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as\\nthe Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series\\nmultiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain\\na guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge\\nR4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.\\n\\n\\nIf that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or\\nmis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our\\ncustomer base.\\n\\n\\nMost SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a\\ngreat deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because\\nagain, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule\\nslipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were\\ncounting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and\\nwould also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial\\nanalysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our\\ncommitments.\\n\\n\\nFive years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor\\ntechnologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at\\nleast 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature\\nof the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is\\nreally 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability\\nof whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.\\n\\nThere are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live\\nwith, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,\\nwe know it.\\n\\nJosh   |:-)\\n\\n-- \\n\",\n",

He was unable\\n##to find a wealth of scientific statements in the Holy Qur'an, but,\\n##what he did find made sense with modern understanding.

       "  '\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade\\n\\nMAGI: \\n\\n[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\n ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\n most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\n second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain \\netymology. It may originally have meant \"member of the tribe,\" as in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). This meaning\\nwould have been further resticted, among the Medes, to \"member of the priestly\\ntribe\" and perhaps to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is\\nprobably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the \"Magoi\" as one of\\nthe six tribes of the Medes.\\n  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a\\npriestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were\\nresponsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their\\nknowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political\\nand civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced\\nconcerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is\\ndemonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by\\nDarius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by\\nGreek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the\\nsacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be\\nattested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.\\n  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi\\nare members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is\\nuntenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the\\nAvestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), is\\nnot without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two opposed principles of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as \"chorus,\" from\\nthe root mangh, which is said to mean \"sing the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nhas been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an\\necstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms\\nmagavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is \\nperhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the\\nPahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derives from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). During\\nthe Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priests\") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons\\nof putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this\\nrite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was\\nin vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with\\nwax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples\\nof Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to\\noffer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the\\ncustodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the\\nrelationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was\\ncalled upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of killing harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animals (khrafstra)\\nsuch as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,\\ntunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose\\nand mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition\\nthat is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was\\nthat of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they\\ngradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of\\nprofessional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally\\ninclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been\\njealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this\\nthey were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible\\nfor teaching the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes\" and thus\\nthe \"cult of the gods.\" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself\\nSmerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed\\nas a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men\\nwho arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;\\nthis was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goes,\" \"expert in the magic arts\" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the\\nChaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.\\n  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it\\nis necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called\\nwestern Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in\\nvarying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.\\n  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their\\nvarying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their\\ncustoms, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the\\nMagi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted\\nZoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and\\nplaced themselves under his venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those\\nelements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjuring\\ndaivas\"), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of\\ntexts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and\\npractices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nhas been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirectly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to\\nus especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles\\nof the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-\\nformation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known\\nto the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously\\nimportant role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\'s treachings, as well as in\\nthe definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began\\nto study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,\\nHermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises\\non the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have\\nsurvived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting\\nground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous\\n_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which\\nmost likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the\\nreligious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of\\nIran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an\\northodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures\\nin the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.',\n",

Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology\\nPolicy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the\\nRedesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance\\nto the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space\\nstation.\\n\\n        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a\\nhigh option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each\\noption would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,\\noperations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research\\noperations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.\\n\\n        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA\\nbudget for the President\\'s new technology investment.  As a result,\\nstation options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting\\nreductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station\\noption of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA\\nbudget over the next 5 years.\\n\\n        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of\\nthe advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon\\nadministrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the\\nStation Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory\\ncommittee to consider.\\n\\n        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have\\ndecided, after consultation, to give \"full consideration\" to use of\\nRussian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.\\n\\n        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the\\nredesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign\\nteam can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR\\nand the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.\\nThe U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of\\nthe Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing\\nstation costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.\\nCareful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving\\nthat goal.\\n\\n        Gibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is committed to the\\nredesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the\\nscience, the technology and the jobs that the space station program\\nrepresents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well\\nmanaged and one that does not consume the national resources which should\\nbe used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.\"\\n\\n        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian\\nparticipation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science\\nCenter at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald\\nSagdeev.',\n",

       "  '\\nActually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused\\n\"objective morality\" to look very \"relative.\"  After all, that was the\\npoint of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out\\nChristianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own\\nprinciples?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this\\napparent inconsistency from at least one Christian\\'s viewpoint:\\n\\nIf God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then\\nHe has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick\\nphysically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an \"objective\" morality for us.\\nThat is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or\\ndetrimental to) the creature He created. \\n\\n\\tGalatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in\\n\\tChrist Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared\\n\\tbeforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.\\n\\nHowever, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees\\nof the Bible,) God\\'s morality cannot be completely codified in a list\\nof rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a\\nperson\\'s life creates a new situation to which morality must be\\napplied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God\\'s\\n\"objective\" morality for us. \\n\\nThroughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of\\nrules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the\\nprinciples were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.\\nVolumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principles.  We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principles. \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverses 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancients were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commits murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who is\\n\\tangry with his brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God gets blurred by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors\\nwhen we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY\\nwhat God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to\\nseeking God\\'s will instead of trying to prove we already had it all\\nfigured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God\\'s\\n\"objective morality\" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he\\nwas/is (and that\\'s the fundamental question,) then HE IS \"objective\\nmorality.\" ',\n",

(I have done\\nsome editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original\\nannouncement.) \\n\\nFor those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is\\nthe leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training\\nof aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe\\ndesign, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.\\nVirtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,\\nSu, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.\\n\\nI had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at\\nMAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an\\nF-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening\\nexperience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year\\nor so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to\\nsee some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines\\nfor future space craft use.\\n\\nIf you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would\\nbe glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it\\'s faculty\\nhave e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the\\nreceiver to get the message.

Hopefully, you won\\'t\\nget flamed, either.\\n\\nYou will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is\\nbuilt on unsteady ground.\\n\\nFirst, I do not believe that there is any way to find an \"objective morality\". \\nMorality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a\\nperson or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even\\noverwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.\\n\\n\\nSecond, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say,\\nyou are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by\\nusing the Christian Bible?  You\\'re defeating your own purpose by doing so.\\n \\n\\nThird, call me a pessimist, but you won\\'t stop the flamage.  There will always\\nbe people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we\\nall are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the\\nreligion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,\\noverbearing totalitarianists?\\n \\n\\nHm.

I\\nstart off by saying that I think it\\'s immoral to force people to have sex with\\nyou.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of\\nyour own gender.  (Just a note: I really don\\'t know your views on\\nhomosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the\\npurposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to\\nhave their faces uncovered.\\n\\nThe sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but\\nfeels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. \\n                                                                         \\n\\n\\t(Evidence deleted)\\n\\nI\\'m not going to accept your evidence for this.

       "  'There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today\\'s\\nLA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsaying that I largely agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station\\nmiss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, \"What\\'s New\" -\\nthe weekly physics update we get here on the net - it\\'s clear that the\\nromance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with\\nits spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things\\npeople are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but\\nI think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\'s Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisis.\\n\\nThe reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no\\nlonger define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nrewards.  \\n\\nSpace exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America\\'s science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies\\nfor telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes\\nwould be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation is now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively\\nsupported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,\\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively\\nimplemented did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar\\nspace budgets.\\n\\nIndeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration\\nwith programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel\\nGoldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space\\nAdministration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being\\npositioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\'s\\ntechnological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been\\nslashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions\\nits competitiveness agenda.\\n\\n......',\n",

And, again, the mating\\npractices need to be reexamined...\\n\\n\\nNo, but mating practices are a special case.  I\\'ll have to think about it\\nsome more.\\n\\n\\nIndeed.  But, while the natural system is objective, all objective systems\\nare not the natural one.  So, the terms can not be equated.  The natural\\nsystem is a subset of the objective ones.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t claim that homosexuality is immoral.  It isn\\'t harmful, although\\nit isn\\'t helpful either (to the mating process).

       "  \"Hi everyone,\\n\\nI thought that some people may be interested in my VR\\nsoftware on these groups:\\n\\n*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******\\n\\nMultiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality\\nsystem, primarily focused on entertainment/research.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.\\n   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).\\n   Generic clients.\\n   Customizable servers.\\n   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).\\n   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).\\n   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily\\n        attached.\\n\\nFunctionality:\\n\\n  Client:\\n   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things\\n   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's\\n   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's\\n   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to\\n   other users.\\n\\n   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to\\n   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that\\n   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting\\n   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.\\n\\n   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:\\n\\n    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)\\n\\n    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)\\n\\n    o User Interface Panels\\n\\n    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for\\n\\tfaster frame rates)\\n\\n    o Mouse and Keyboard Input\\n\\n   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the\\n   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because\\n   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)\\n\\n  Server(s):\\n   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is\\n   provided in this release for potential world server developers:\\n\\n    o Transparent Client Management\\n\\n    o Client Message Handling\\n\\n   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of\\naccepting and\\n   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the\\napplication writer\\n   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.\\n\\n   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is\\n   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:\\n\\n    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:\\n        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended\\n        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension\\n        initialisers you want.\\n\\n    o Event Handler Registration:\\n        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback\\n        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.\\n        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)\\n\\n    o Collision Detection Registration:\\n        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide\\n        some basic information to the collision detection management software.\\n        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.\\n\\n    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because\\n    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects\\n    from which to choose.\\n\\n    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:\\n\\n    o Provide an initWorld function:\\n        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus\\n        any initialization you want to do.\\n\\n    o Provide a positionObject function:\\n        This is where you determine where to place a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:\\n        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.\\n\\n    o Provide a getWorldType function:\\n        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.\\n\\n    o Provide an animateWorld function:\\n        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects\\n        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit\\n        (to avoid outrunning the clients).\\n\\n    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the\\n    three world servers I've provided:\\n\\n        generic - 81 lines\\n        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the\\n                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future\\n                           versions)\\n        dogfight - 72 lines\\n\\nLocation:\\n\\n   This software is located at the following site:\\n   ftp.u.washington.edu\\n\\n   Directory:\\n   pub/virtual-worlds\\n\\n   File:\\n   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z\\n\\nFutures:\\n\\n   Client:\\n\\n    o Texture mapping.\\n\\n    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading\\n\\n    o HMD support.\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Server:\\n\\n    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).\\n\\n    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction\\n\\n    o Etc, etc....\\n\\n   Both:\\n\\n    o Improved Comms!!!\\n\\nI hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse\\nsoftware,\\nunfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure\\nwhether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(\\n\\nI hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of\\nthe Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I\\nwould *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!\\n\\nFinally one major disclaimer:\\n\\nThis is totally amateur code.

They are meant for fruitive results, which\\ncause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive\\nactivities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of\\nsense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,\\nas a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to\\nthe transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the\\nbeginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme\\ntranscendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are\\nstruggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of\\nthe material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get\\nrid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense\\ngratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the\\nchance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the\\nUpanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a\\npart of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the\\nbeginning of transcendental life.\\n\\n As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in\\nthe material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities\\nsuch as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating\\nsuch dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This\\ntranscendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one\\nis fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.\\n\\nBhagavad-Gita As It is\\nBooks of A.C.

Many of the topics recently\\ndiscussed on sci.space are covered in this.\\n\\nGibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance\\n\\nDr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and\\nTechnology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of\\nthe Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space\\nStation on April 3, three budget options as guidance to\\nthe committee in their deliberations on the redesign of\\nthe space station.\\n\\nA low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7\\nbillion and a high option of $9 billion will be\\nconsidered by the committee. Each option would cover\\nthe total expenditures for space station from fiscal\\nyear 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for\\ndevelopment, operations, utilization, Shuttle\\nintegration, facilities, research operations support,\\ntransition cost and also must include adequate program\\nreserves to insure program implementation within the\\navailable funds.\\n\\nOver the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within\\nthe NASA budget for the President\\'s new technology\\ninvestment. As a result, station options above $7\\nbillion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in\\nthe rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space\\nstation option of $9 billion would require $2 billion\\nin offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.\\n\\nGibbons presented the information at an organizational\\nsession of the advisory committee. Generally, the\\nmembers-designate focused upon administrative topics\\nand used the session to get acquainted. They also\\nreceived a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation\\non the process the Station Redesign Team is following\\nto develop options for the advisory committee to\\nconsider.\\n\\nGibbons also announced that the United States and its\\ninternational partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and\\nCanadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give\\n\"full consideration\" to use of Russian assets in the\\ncourse of the space station redesign process.\\n\\nTo that end, the Russians will be asked to participate\\nin the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting\\nbasis, so that the redesign team can make use of their\\nexpertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the\\npossible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and\\nsystems. The U.S. and international partners hope to\\nbenefit from the expertise of the Russian participants\\nin assessing Russian systems and technology. The\\noverall goal of the redesign effort is to develop\\noptions for reducing station costs while preserving key\\nresearch and exploration capabilities. Careful\\nintegration of Russian assets could be a key factor in\\nachieving that goal.\\n\\nGibbons reiterated that, \"President Clinton is\\ncommitted to the redesigned space station and to making\\nevery effort to preserve the science, the technology\\nand the jobs that the space station program represents.\\nHowever, he also is committed to a space station that\\nis well managed and one that does not consume the\\nnational resources which should be used to invest in\\nthe future of this industry and this nation.\"',\n",

They are\\nnot trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).\\n\\nWhy an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly\\nout of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere \\nin his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which \\nit lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.\\n\\nUntil you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about\\nthe Josephus insert, your \"proof\" is meaningless and it should not be repeated\\nhere.  What\\'s more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would \"prove\"\\nnothing.  Scholars speak of the \"weight of evidence.\"  Far more independent\\nevidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your\\nbelief is based on faith.  That\\'s OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass\\nfaith off as fact.\\n\\nAs for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring\\ninconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn\\'t a perfect canon be perfect? \\nShouldn\\'t there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel \\nFictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for \\nHerb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share \\nan evolutionary ancestry).\\n\\nThe fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny\\nyour position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels \"prove\" your faith. \\nIndependent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already\\ndiscussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. \\nMoreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted\\nto \"prove\" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than\\nsaying \"I am right because I say so.\"  \\n\\nYour logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian \\nGeneral Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where\\n\"fundamentalist\" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)\\nJesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily\\nresurrected, 4) Jesus\\' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the\\nclincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe\\n\"inerrant\" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the\\nfirst four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant\\nbible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to \\ncontain the first four.  \\n\\nSmoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!\\n\\nIts faith, Bill.  You don\\'t have any more or better truths than anyone else. \\nWhatever works for you.  Just don\\'t foist it on others. \\n\\nRegards,',\n",

S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, \"Love is the unfamiliar Name\\nthat wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...\"\\n\\nThis is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise\\nin my note, as will become more evident below.\\n\\n\\nblechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,\\ngiven my principle that one CANNOT force one\\'s own notion of \"sin\" on\\nanother, and my unshakeable \"disestablishmentarianism\", Russel Turpin\\nand others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my\\nlegislating my own understanding of Christian love.\\n\\n\\nYou misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of\\naccusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form\\nas anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human\\nbeings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) \"God\"\\nin near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that always exists\" is that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed\\nconstitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note\\nthat the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian\\nargumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]\\nprohibitions.\\n\\nWhat Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:\\n\\n\\tA.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved\\n\\t    in the Inquisition.\\n\\n\\tB.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however\\n\\t    painful this *seems*, \"discipline\" her children for their\\n\\t    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or\\n\\t    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example\\n\\t    \"deterring\" others from the same loss-of-soul.)\\n\\n\\tA.  I point out that this \"justification\" of a failure in love\\n\\t    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of\\n\\t    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.\\n\\n\\tB.  Burns me at the stake.\\n\\nMy rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is\\ngoing on here has a *lot* to do with \"cultural baggage.\"  In this case,\\nthe baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief\\nthat an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most\\nbelievable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least\\ngreatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor\\'s B,\\nthen my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fails in this case -- as it will fail in\\nmay others.  At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succeed when it\\nproperly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that\\nmany of the victims of Inquisition will have \"accepted\" that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty\\nof charges brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point is that the \"persuasion\" breaks down when the parties do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it is *bound* to break down\\nin precisely the \"worst\" cases.  The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\nis the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he is \"justified\" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to\\na \"greater good.\"  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, as if one\\'s theories about \"sin\" entitled one to cast aside\\nJesus\\' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).\\n\\nI am a \"radical\" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.\\n\\n\\nWell, the whole *point* of making these the \"base\" commandments is that\\nthey *aren\\'t* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a\\nlaw code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful\\nto individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a\\npersonal involvement in and responsibility for one\\'s actions.  The Great\\nCommandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were\\nGod and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A\\ndemand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping\\nup nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important\\nthat I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  \"Conservatives\"\\nmay twist this \"act as if you were God\" to mean \"lay down rules for other\\npeople and be as nasty to them as possible if they don\\'t keep YOUR rules.\"\\nThey are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a\\nlot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy\\nIS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation \"against\\nGod\" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the \"conservatives\" have\\nconfused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other\\npeople with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard\\nAmerican atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.\\n\\n\\nAnd different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged\\n*different* \"ethical systems\" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,\\nit is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular\\n(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.\\nIt does not have a QU\\'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very\\nlittle, if anything, in the way of \"commandments\" -- so little that\\nthe \"Christians\" who desperately *want* commandments go \"mining\" for\\nthem with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))\\nfor their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus\\nspecifically \"gives\" as \"a commandment\" to us is \"love one another.\"\\n\\n\\t[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson\\n\\t that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that\\n\\t SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I\\'ll\\n\\t point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why\\n\\t there is a huge amount of \"cultural baggage\" involved.]\\n\\nYou are quite right that this is \"goo\" if one is looking for an ethical\\nsystem.\\n\\nBut why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our\\nsociety is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?

There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence\\nof gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most\\nphilosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that\\nmust be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical\\nbasis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?\\n \\nThere is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence\\nof any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses\\nword \"on faith\", we just mean that having found this person to be\\nreliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.\\nIf we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence\\neverywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about\\ngods?\\n \\nThe difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then\\none of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,\\nrather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith\\nis in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable\\nbasis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at\\nother times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist\\nbelieves that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable\\nknowledge.

       "  'I\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\\n\\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n',\n",

       "  '\\nIt helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least\\na reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short\\ndescription of the process which we use; if you have further questions,\\nfeel free to poke me via e-mail.\\n\\n================================================================\\n*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion\\n\\n0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This\\n   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are\\n   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.\\n   Consider deleting these edges.\\n\\n1) Now, there are two goals:\\n\\n    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)\\n    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)\\'s)\\n       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured \\n       using the digitized (x,y)\\'s).\\n\\n2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For\\n   example:\\n\\n    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you\\n       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will\\n       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the\\n       Reference(x,y). \\n    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.\\n       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge\\n       the correct length (where \"correct\" is the DigitizedLength). \\n       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the\\n       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the\\n       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.\\n\\n3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).\\n\\nalpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider\\nhow much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist\\non the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to\\nbalance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length\\nof the edges.\\n\\nWARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be\\nobserved (essentially, you can\\'t allow the convex hull to change, and\\nyou can\\'t allow triangles to \"fold over\" neighboring triangles.  Both of\\nthese can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of\\nindividual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using \\nthe current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the\\noriginal positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was\\nprohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and\\nchange code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I\\n*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more\\ncompute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having\\nevery point interact with every other point....but first read up on\\nlinear solutions to the n-body problem.\\n\\nThere are lots of papers in the last 10 years of SIGGRAPH proceedings on\\nsprings, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.

He is the seal of all prophets\\ntill the day of judgement as stated in the Qur\\'an by Allah\\nSWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between\\n571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,\\nis a treason against Islam, against Qur\\'an, against the message\\nof Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another\\nmessenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.\\nHe is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his\\ncoming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur\\'an is from \\nChapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:\\n\\n\\tMuhammad is not the father of any of your men,\\n\\tbut (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal\\n\\tof the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of\\n\\tall things.\\n\\n---------------------\\nCommentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,\\nit is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The \\nHoly Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.\\nAllah\\'s teaching is and will always be continuous, but there\\nhas been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later\\nages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not\\nan arbitrary matter.

In\\nfact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate\\nunbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise\\nOur\\'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His\\nmiracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) \\nsorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their\\nfollowers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the\\ncertainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars\\nof Islam) to the hundreth degree.\\n   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of\\nthe universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the\\neffect of the words,\\'You have indeed spoken the truth !\\'\\n   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,\\nwhile being observed by Him, \\'The true ruler has\\nappointed me to such and such position.  \\'At a time when\\nyou were asked to prove your claim, the word \\'Yes\\'\\nuttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if\\nthe ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your\\nrequest, this would confirm your claim even more soundly\\nand more definitely than would the word \\'Yes.\\'\\n   In the same way, ALLAH\\'s Most Noble Messenger\\nclaimed: \\'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this\\nuniverse.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken\\norder at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my\\nfingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five\\nspigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He\\nsplits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear\\nwitness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at\\nthis food: although it is barely enough for two or three\\nmen, it satisfies two or three hundred.  \\'Further he shows\\nhundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of\\nthe veracity of this high being and the proofs of his\\nprophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his\\ndeeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral\\nconduct and manners, his character and appearance\\nprove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.\\nIndeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the\\nfamous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief\\nmerely by seeing him, and said, \\'No lie can hide in this\\nface, nor can any fraud be found in it!\\'\\n   Although many of the  researchers have concluded\\nthat the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his\\nmiracles number about one thousand, there are\\nthousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of\\nhis prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of\\ntruth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions\\nhave affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of\\nways.\\n   The Wise Our\\'an alone demonstrates thousands of\\nthe proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty\\naspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a\\nphenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of\\nindividuals who claimed prophethood and performed\\nmiracles have lived and passed away; then, the\\nprophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity\\nsuperior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For\\nwhatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the\\nmeans of the prophethood and messengership of all the\\nmessengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they\\nare all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive\\nfashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and\\nmeans of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the\\nperson of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found\\nin him with more certanity than all the other prophets.\\n',\n",

Hopefully the LDS \\n  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)\\n\\nSince it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin\\nof the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say \"no good\"\\nbecause it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not \\nthe authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time \\nbefore I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, \\nProfessor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the \\nfollowing as part of a book review section in This People\\'s magazine (Spring \\n1993 edition):\\n\\n  \"I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--\\n  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other \\n  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian \\n  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around\\n  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude\\n  those who don\\'t fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central\\n  defining characteristic of a good American might be \"one who doesn\\'t draw\\n  exclusive circles\" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the \\n  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to\\n  draw a circle around \"Mormon\" or \"Christian,\" to decide who is \"orthodox\"\\n  and who isn\\'t by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider\\n  that the central pillar of Christ\\'s \"orthodoxy\" is our ability to love\\n  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.\\n\\n  \"I recently spent some time in a \"Christian\" bookstore in California. The\\n  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and\\n  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural\\n  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.\\n  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking \\n  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American\\n  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to \"Cults and the\\n  Occult,\" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same\\n  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found\\n  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers\\n  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous\\n  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations\\n  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).\\n\\n  \"It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to\\n  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (\"Perfect\\n  love casteth out fear,\" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the\\n  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a \\n  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the\\n  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive\\n  action---as the \"religious right wing\" has launched this year against the\\n  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don\\'t like.\\n  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the\\n  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,\\n  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons\\' rights along with those of\\n  others they believe to be evil.\"\\n\\n\\nThe above \"sermon\" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe\\nto This People\\'s magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who\\nrely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His\\narms.  \\n\\nEven though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles \\nof the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim \\nperfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do \\nnow lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled \"Christian\", if \\nthose who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are \\nintollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical \\nscriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication \\nthan mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the \\nmajority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective \\nvoice is louder.  That\\'s really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand\\non in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter \\nthe LDS Church\\' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths \\nand non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to \\ndisprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. \\nLet us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion \\nand conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.  \\n',\n",

If this has already disappeared from your site,\\nthen please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this\\nexcellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.\\n\\nRegarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based\\ncompletely on the Qur\\'an and contains numerous Qur\\'anic verses and\\nhadiths to support its point of view.\\n\\nOur approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform\\na particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is\\npart of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean\\nthat Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\nonly an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an\\nideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings.\\nTo say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking --\\nIslam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a\\nfree-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of \\ncapitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is\\nbecause Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in\\nthe sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is\\ncompletely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history\\nshows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reasons for this situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are\\nfollowing the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by \"following the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis\\nthat is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical\\nfact which contradicts your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it.\\nSo far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is\\nquite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views\\nmakes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of\\nthis.\\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly\\nwith respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.

The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious\\nfor its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German\\ngovt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\'s friends\\nwere prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a \\nproduct of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite willing to overlook Roehm\\'s homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So \\nit seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, \\nregardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the \"evils\" of homosexuality.\\nWhy should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all \\nsocieties - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you\\nwill accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access \\nto these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern\\nhomosexuality that I have ever read - I don\\'t have the time. Nothing is\\nstopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove\\notherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.',\n",

       "  'I\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nNote for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a\\nsingle staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3\\nscale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is \\ncurrently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale \\nexperimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.\\n\\nOn April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled \\n\"Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions\" here at the University of\\nIllinois. Mr Nelson\\'s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and\\ndetermine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is\\nnot directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with \\nthem recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used \\nthe DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don\\'t think the details\\nof implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope\\nthey aren\\'t - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will\\nbe interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.\\n\\nThe first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The\\nmain restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that\\nthis is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I\\ndid not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters\\nand 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in \\nmid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson\\nshowed the following plot of acceleration vs time:\\n                  ______\\n3 G         /|   /      |\\n           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly \\n          /  | /        |\\t   good.  The big difference is that the lines\\n2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are\\n        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as\\n       /                |          the graph wasn\\'t up for very long.\\n1 G   /                 |\\n                        |\\n                        |\\n0 G                     |\\n\\n             ^          ^\\n           ~100 sec    ~400 sec\\n\\n\\nAs mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below\\n3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the\\naccelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are \\nthrotled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it\\nsoon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in \\naccelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines\\nbring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut\\nout entirely.\\n\\nThe engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed\\nfor an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of\\nair drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to \\nthat desired.\\n\\nQuestions from the audience:  (paraphrased)\\n\\nQ:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than\\n    all at once?\\n\\nA:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.\\n\\nQ:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?\\n\\nA:  Can\\'t tell us.  \"Read Aviation Leak.\"  He also apparently had a good \\n    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  \\n\\nMy question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting\\nnational security or MD protecting their own interests?\\n\\nThe second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch\\nup maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and \\nthe parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs\\nof heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,\\nand I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.\\nThe end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have\\nabout 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it\\'s reentry profile about \\n60 degrees south latitude.\\n\\nI would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn\\'t know about that\\naspect of the flight profile.\\n',\n",
       "  'What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and\\nthe algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which\\nrequires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns\\nwhether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn\\nmethod.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several\\ncomparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the\\nscreen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My\\nmethod basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the\\nscreen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of\\nsomething, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so\\nmerely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are\\nlooking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.

Note the early use of\\nPostScript technology, predating many of this year\\'s papers listed in the\\nApril 1st SIGGRAPH Program Announcement posted here a few days ago.\\n\\n-- Eric\\n\\n\\nIntersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),\\n\\tby Dave Baraff, Tom Duff\\n\\n\\tFrom: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu\\n\\tNewsgroups: comp.graphics\\n\\tKeywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem\\n\\tOrganization: Program of Computer Graphics\\n\\n\\nI think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and\\npolygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of\\npoints.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.\\n\\nFirst, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies\\ncompletely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,\\nor possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phrasing of this question says \"if a line intersects a polygon\", so\\nthis is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is\\nto reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a\\nnew language called PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe Systems\\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraws the line L and the polygon P, and then \"outputs\" the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program executes a command called \"showpage\", which\\nactually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus\\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problems with this approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalently, Zorn\\'s Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.\\n\\n\\t(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother words, will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a\\n\\tTuring Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is\\n\\tundecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite\\nprecision and running out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of references might be:\\n\\n1.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\\n\\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\\n\\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\\n\\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\\nindex is near the optimal level.\\n\\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\\n\\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\\n\\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\\nanomaly team.\\n\\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\\n\\n\\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\\n\\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC',\n",
       "  '-------------------------------------\\n\\t+ ............The OTIS Project \\'93  +      \\n\\t+ \"The Operative Term Is STIMULATE\" + \\n\\t-------------------------------------\\n\\t---this file last updated..4-21-93---\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS OTIS?\\n\\nOTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork\\nand photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    \\nand distribution.  Digital immortality.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind \"digital immortality\" is that computer networks   \\nare here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them\\nwill be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the\\nartifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they\\'ll be put in different\\nformats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they\\'ll be\\nthere...and someone will dig them up.  \\n \\nIf that doesn\\'t interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique\\nand exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes\\nand exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang\\nas wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is \\nbreathed into your work...and by merit of it\\'s stimulus, it will \\ntravel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.\\n \\nSpectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and \\nlet the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own\\ncopies of the images to look at when you\\'ve got the gumption...\\nthat\\'s what they\\'re here for.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nWHERE?             \\n\\nOTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  \\n \\n \\t141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site\\n\\t\\t\\n\\tsunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite \\n\\t(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)\\n\\nMerely \"anonymous FTP\" to either site on Internet and change to the\\nappropriate directory.  Don\\'t forget to get busy and use the \"bin\"\\ncommand to make sure you\\'re in binary.\\n\\nOTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North\\nAmerica....the following systems have a substancial supply of\\nOTIStuff...\\n\\tUnderground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines\\n\\tCyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\nHOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?\\n              \\nWhat happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   \\nphoto, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put\\nit in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me\\n(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,\\nit will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works\\nare also welcome.\\n\\nOTIS\\' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  \\nGIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to \\nsee.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at \\nmost large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit\\ntougher to find.  If you can\\'t find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  \\nyou can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    \\nJPG files to a standard GIF format. \\n\\nOTIS also accepts animation files.      \\n\\nWhen you submit image files, please send me email at the same time\\nstating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be\\nused (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people\\nto view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we\\'ll\\nbe having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You \\ncan also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of \\nemailing).\\n\\nIf you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send\\ncopies to:\\n\\nThe OTIS Project\\nc/o Ed Stastny\\nPO BX 241113\\nOmaha, NE 68124-1113\\n\\nI will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  \\nscan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  \\nAlso include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line \\ndescription of the image that we can include in the infofile in the\\ndirectory where it\\'s finally put.  If you have preferences as to what\\nthe images are to be named, include those as well.  \\n \\nConversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange things.\\n\\nIf you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThis is good for people who don\\'t have direct access to encoders or FTP,\\nbut do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most formats...we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to \\nget a slab-o-OTIS.\\n\\nAs of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   \\non the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is\\nnot altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local \\nbulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text files along with the images.  \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post images\\nfrom OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.\\n\\nIt\\'s the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as\\npossible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBBS system....or even just post this \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the \\nstipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or\\nfull address credit).  You will either find this in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or series of images...or in the \"Artists\" directory under the \\nArtists name.  If permission isn\\'t explicitly given, then you\\'ll have \\nto contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email\\nme (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I\\'ll get in contact with the artist for \\nyou, or give you their contact information.\\n \\nWhen you DO use permitted work, it\\'s always courteous to let the artist\\nknow about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such\\ncompensation for their files.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nNAMING IMAGES?\\n\\nPlease keep the names of your files in \"dos\" format.  That means, keep\\nthe filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way\\nI usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or\\nfour digit \"code\" for the series of images, plus the series number.\\nThus, Leonardo DeVinci\\'s fifth mechanical drawing would be something\\nlike:\\n \\n\\tldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC\\n\\nKeeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will\\nremain intact on all systems.  \\n\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------- \\n\\nCREATING IMAGE FILES?\\n\\nWhen creating image files, be sure to at least include your name\\nsomewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in\\ncase they\\'d like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,\\naddress or other information you\\'d like people to know.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nHMMM?!\\n\\nThat\\'s about it for now.  More \"guidelines\" will be added as needed.\\nYour input is expected.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project has no connection to the Church of OTIS  \\n \\t     (a sumerian deity) or it\\'s followers, be they pope, priest,\\n\\t     or ezine administrator.  We do take sacrifices and donations\\n\\t     however.\\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original \\n \\t     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  \\n\\t     It\\'s possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone\\n\\t     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  \\n    \\t     Unless you\\'ve given permission for that, it\\'s illegal.  OTIS\\n\\t     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights\\n\\t     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to \\n\\t     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed \\n\\t     electronically.  If you don\\'t want your images distributed     \\n\\t     all-over, don\\'t upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is\\n\\t     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or\\n\\t     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not \\n\\t     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        \\n\\t     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific\\n\\t     permission for this sort of usage.  \\n\\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nRemember, the operative term is \"stimulate\".  If you know of people\\nthat\\'d be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick\\'m\\nin the booty....offer them free food...whatever...\\n\\n....e  (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu)\\n       (ed@sunsite.unc.edu)\\n',\n",

The insults you have seen quoted thus\\nfar are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean\\'s \\nmind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.\\nOne wonders whether Dean\\'s mind is so warped as to find sport in all\\nthis.\\n\\nHe even dredges up a falsified account of\\nevents that transpired earlier on another thread:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwas in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthe \"sins\" of other individuals.\"\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFalse.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one\\'s sins.\\nThat I made public announcements of the \"sins\" of others\\n--\"sins\", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in\\nthe posts of others-- is a different matter.\\n\\nMany of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that\\nthey do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so\\nI pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,\\nYOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.\\n\\nDean again:\\n\\n\"You made an ass of yourself\\nby saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was\\nsomehow an attempt to \"paint Jews as plaster saints,\" thereby\\nrevealing your inability to understand the discussion as well\\nas showing your dislike for people saying positive things\\nabout Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by\\nrepeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then\\nclaiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.\"\\n\\nActually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew\\nwho gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite\\naccording to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing\\nJewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as\\nimplicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.\\n\\nI went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of\\nthe doubt in a post following my initial crack about \"plaster saints\", \\nsuggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.\\n\\nIn an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly\\ndistorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as\\nthe basis of one insult after another.',\n",

I used \"best\" in part to indicate \\nthat science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are\\nmostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the\\nmatter.  As an aside, for science I should have written \"how and when\".  Nobody\\nseems to argue over what.\\n\\n\\nSeems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I\\'m not\\ntrying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.\\nOn the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which\\nyou know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological\\nperspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I \\nthink the masses can\\'t get along without religion.  Not that generally they are \\nincapable; they just don\\'t, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to \\nbe the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore \\nit seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for \\ndispensing answers to \"who and why\".  I suggest that this holds regardless of \\nthe \"truth\" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  \\nIn the end, spiritual beliefs are just as \"real\" as scientific facts and \\nexplanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  \\n\\n\\nNo.  In fact, I don\\'t think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. \\nIsn\\'t there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was \\ncreated from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might \\npresuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued \\nthat something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn\\'t\\nhave to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that\\'s a tough one for\\npeople today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not \\nexplanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, \\nI agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific \\nas explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but \\nI sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will \\nbe necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty \\nconvoluted here; I hope I\\'ve made sense.  \\n\\n\\nI agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, \\nwhen, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, \\nreason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, \\nand not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the \\nnaturalists\\' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely \\nleaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and\\nthe arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.\\n\\n\\n\\nMuch obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn\\'t it?

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

But they have been systematically \\n          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! \\n\\n               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \"Reciprocal System\", is built on two fundamental \\n          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of \\n          space and time: \\n    \\n               (1) \"The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE \\n          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE \\n          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.\" \\n    \\n               (2) \"The physical universe conforms to the relations of \\n          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are \\n          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.\" \\n    \\n               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE \\n          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of \\n          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-\\n          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward \\n          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light \\n          (which Larson called \"UNIT VELOCITY\" and \"THE NATURAL \\n          DATUM\"). \\n      \\n               At each step in the development, Larson was able to \\n          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the \\n          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles \\n          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star \\n          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white \\n          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET \\n          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY \\n          BURSTS). \\n          \\n               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, \\n          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-\\n          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility \\n          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of \\n          matter. \\n\\n               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy \\n          complex mathematics, in his books. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          BOOKS of Dewey B.

Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the \\n          organization that was started to promote Larson\\'s Theory.  \\n          They have other related publications, including the quarterly \\n          journal \"RECIPROCITY\". \\n\\n          \\n\\n          Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s Background\\n    \\n               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer \\n          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he \\n          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in \\n          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He \\n          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE \\n          chemical properties based only on the elements used. \\n    \\n               Larson\\'s lack of a fancy \"PH.D.\" degree might be one \\n          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is \\n          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider \\n          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same \\n          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX \\n          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, \\n          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC \\n          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. \\n     \\n               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally \\n          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  \\n          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER \\n          researchers\\' experimental and observational data.  And in \\n          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. \\n    \\n               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX \\n          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking \\n          for a \"unified field theory\" that works, but have been \\n          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! \\n    \\n               \"Modern physics\" does NOT explain the physical universe \\n          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson\\'s books are FULL of \\n          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who \\n          agree.  And remember that \"epicycles\", \"crystal spheres\", \\n          \"geocentricity\", \"flat earth theory\", etc., ALSO once SEEMED \\n          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. \\n    \\n    \\n               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, \\n          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson\\'s Theory, and was (or \\n          still is) President of Larson\\'s organization, \"THE \\n          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE\", and Editor of \\n          their quarterly Journal \"RECIPROCITY\".  He moved to \\n          Minneapolis after retiring. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          \"Super Collider\" BOONDOGGLE!\\n          \\n               I am AGAINST contruction of the \"Superconducting Super \\n          Collider\", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS \\n          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of \"scientific\" \\n          value. \\n    \\n               Most physicists don\\'t realize it, but, according to the \\n          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY \\n          particles (\"mesons\", \"hyperons\", ALLEGED \"quarks\", etc.) \\n          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, \\n          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are \\n          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly \\n          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible \\n          with their environment. \\n    \\n               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a \\n          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not \\n          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE \\n          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! \\n    \\n               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 \\n          BILLION cost?!!  Don\\'t we have much more important uses for \\n          this WASTED money?! \\n    \\n     \\n               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed \\n          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some \\n          kind of \"fire ants\" eating the insulation off underground \\n          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water \\n          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of \\n          the \"Supercollider\"?! \\n    \\n          \\n               Naming the \"Super Collider\" after Ronald Reagon, as \\n          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be \\n          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. \\n      \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter\\n          \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of \\n          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more \\n          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the \\n          photons of which they are made, in relation to the \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, \\n          which Larson calls \"Unit Velocity\" and the \"Natural Datum\". \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, a positron is actually a particle of \\n          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, \\n          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their \\n          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each \\n          other. \\n      \\n               In Larson\\'s Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical \\n          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension \\n          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our \\n          MATERIAL half. \\n       \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Relativity\\n          \\n               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury \\n          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the \\n          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this \\n          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational \\n          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, \\n          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to \\n          help \"prove\" Einstein\\'s \"General Theory of Relativity\". \\n    \\n               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results \\n          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than \"General Relativity\" can, by \\n          INSTEAD using \"SPECIAL Relativity\".  In one or more of his \\n          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH \\n          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. \\n    \\n               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED \"General Relativity\" as another \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of \"Special \\n          Relativity\", including the parts about \"mass increases\" near \\n          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on \\n          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than \\n          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, \\n          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). \\n     \\n               In Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the \\n          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead \\n          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often used the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writing \\n          about this.] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"mass increases\", it has been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near \\n          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is \\n          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists \\n          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson\\'s Theory, \\n          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is \\n          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS \\n          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  \\n          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward \\n          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of \\n          the so-called \"Big Bang\" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL \\n          FANTASY). \\n    \\n                                    \\n          \\n          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\\n\\n               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book \"THE UNIVERSE \\n          OF MOTION\", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific \\n          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 \\n          pages, indexed, hardcover. \\n    \\n               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL \\n          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that \\n          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. \\n    \\n               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical \\n          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and \\n          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of \\n          the \"3-degree\" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-\\n          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white \\n          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. \\n    \\n               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL \\n          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with \\n          OPEN MINDS! \\n    \\n               The following is an example of his Theory\\'s success: \\n          In his first book in 1959, \"THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL \\n          UNIVERSE\", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING \\n          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding \\n          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\'s \\n          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he \\n          had an immediate related explanation for them also. \\n    \\n\\n \\n          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS\\n\\n               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were \\n          originally thought to originate from \"neutron stars\" in the \\n          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions \\n          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of \\n          his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", published in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at \\n          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do \\n          not correspond with known objects, and come from all \\n          directions uniformly.) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to us in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which \\n          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were \\n          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of \\n          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is \\n          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of his other books. \\n    \\n               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction comes from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star\\'s internal \\n          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually \\n          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter elements. \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms \\n          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some \\n          of his books [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less \\n          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to \\n          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and \\n          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall \\n          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite directions on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chances of the two masses falling back into the \\n          exact same location in space, making a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbiting each other. \\n     \\n               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the \\n          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown \\n          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          stars\", \"black holes\", etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected \\n          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all \\n          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          his own version of Bode\\'s Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently \\n          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO \"black \\n          holes\" merging together into a SINGLE \"black hole\", and \\n          concluded that the new \"black hole\" would have MORE MASS than \\n          the sum of the two original \"black holes\". \\n    \\n               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED \\n          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of \"black \\n          holes\", etc.! \\n    \\n               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson\\'s books about \\n          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe, especially his book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", it is \\n          clear to me that \"black holes\" are NOTHING more than \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is \\n          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the \"black \\n          hole\" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want \\n          to \"prove\" their theory. \\n    \\n    \\n               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is \\n          being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and \\n          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking\\'s severe physical \\n          problem somehow makes him \"wiser\".  It does NOT! \\n    \\n               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist \\n          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread \\n          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson\\'s \\n          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of \\n          Unified Science). \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION\\n\\n               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection \\n          with UFO\\'s and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to \\n          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. \\n    \\n               I found a possible clue about why they might work on \\n          pages 112-113 of the book \"BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER\", by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of \\n          Larson\\'s comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe.  I quote one paragraph: \\n    \\n               \"As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development \\n          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally \\n          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  \\n          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It \\n          was brought out in Volume I [Larson\\'s book \"NOTHING BUT \\n          MOTION\"] that there are physical processes in operation which \\n          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, \\n          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in \\n          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities \\n          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are \\n          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of \\n          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the \\n          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged \\n          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension \\n          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, \\n          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open \\n          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently \\n          in the same location with respect to the natural reference \\n          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the \\n          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, \\n          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by \\n          the progression of the natural reference system.  All \\n          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons \\n          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  \\n          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, \\n          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The \\n          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth \\n          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.\" \\n          \\n               Note that in Larson\\'s Theory, UNcharged electrons are \\n          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a \\n          particular frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) spinning \\n          around one axis at a particular rate (below the \"unit\" rate).  \\n          (\"Unit velocity\" is the speed of light, and there are \\n          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, \\n          according to Larson\\'s Theory.)  [I might have the \"above\" and \\n          \"below\" labels mixed up.] \\n    \\n               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-\\n          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of \\n          light! \\n    \\n               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION \\n          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these \\n          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a \\n          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to \\n          achieve propulsion. (In Larson\\'s Theory, an electrical charge \\n          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular \\n          frequency (above the \"unit\" frequency) superimposed on the \\n          rotation of the particle.) \\n      \\n               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to \\n          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is \\n          generated in clouds. \\n\\n\\n\\n          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics\\n\\n               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical \\n          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B.

       "  'Two developments have brought these type of activities back to\\nthe forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a\\n20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While this \"Banner\" reflector was blank,\\nNPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner\\nreflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-\\nbased video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV\\ncommercial, as filmed from the Mir.\\n   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the\\nsame company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\n804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,\\ndeployed by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\nmaintaining the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone reading\\nsensors\" to \"continuously monitor the condition of the Earth\\'s\\ndelicate protective ozone layer,\" according to Mike Lawson, head of\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum\\nexposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth\\'s\\natmosphere. According to IMI, \"as the biodegradable material burns,\\nit will release ozone-building components that will literally\\nreplenish the ozone layer.\" The remaining spacecraft will monitor\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns\\nup and \"adds to the ozone supply.\"\\n   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several\\nmillions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI\\nestimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\nwatched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising \\'unit\\' cost\\n$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being\\npromoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996\\nSummer Olympics in Atlanta.\\n  \\nBut back to Brian\\'s questions:\\n  \\n    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\nestimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus\\n$10-15 M for a launch), then it\\'s probably real.  They are claiming to\\ntailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for\\noptimum advertising impact so they probably can\\'t piggy back upon\\nsomeone else\\'s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated\\nlaunch.  That\\'s a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.\\n    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as\\nwell.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\nof launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don\\'t think the\\nlegal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,\\nand no, I don\\'t really like the idea of this additional light\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\nchallenges and court fights would probably remove any positive\\naspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the\\nadvertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\nspace advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\nidiot?)\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\'s in a low\\nenough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would\\nonly be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\nafter dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that\\'s the time\\nof worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\nbe a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)\\n    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There\\nwere about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga\\nadvertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for\\nonly a $500,000 commitment.  I haven\\'t heard of any serious funding\\nfor this, but I\\'m sure they are shopping the venture around looking\\nfor some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I\\nam confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.\\n  \\n   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be\\nmy guest.

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers?

So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.

An impressive amount of\\nevidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is\\nlikely that early exons represented early protein domains.\\n\\nIs the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that\\nintron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually\\nhave quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes. \\n\\nOn the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted\\nlater, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed\\nby a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused,\\nif introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have\\nrequired _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated,\\nsince sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are\\nconserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a\\ntrace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and\\nthese are not found in or near intron sequences. \\n\\nI seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and\\ngenetics before posting \"theological arguments\" like this. \\nTry Watson\\'s Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish\\n& Baltimore\\'s Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.\\n\\n: Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does\\n: God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a\\n: theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely\\n: scientific perspective, just different.\\n\\nScientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas \\ntheological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.\\n \\n: I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect,\\n: but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.\\n\\nFor the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support\\nyour assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific\\nperspective, unless you support it by some evidence.\\n\\nIn fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps\\nmore important than we\\'ve thought - for instance, sex might\\nhave evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by\\ncomputer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.) \\n \\n: Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma\\n: rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.\\n\\nIn fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although\\nit is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action. \\n\\n: Actually, neither of us \"knows\" what the atmosphere was like at the\\n: time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most\\n: biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after\\n: all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth\\n: was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I\\n: seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for\\n: the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?\\n\\nI\\'d replace \"created\" with \"formed\", since there is no need to \\ninvoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one.\\nMost recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8\\nbillion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but\\norganic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years.\\nThis would leave more than billion years for the first cells to\\nevolve.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry I can\\'t give any references, this is based on the course\\non evolutionary biochemistry I attended here. \\n\\n: >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer\\n: >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of\\n: >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the\\n: >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  \\n\\nAgain, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for\\nthis supposed \"degeneration\"? \\n\\nI can understand Scott\\'s reaction:\\n\\n: > Excuse me, but this is so far-fetched that I know you must be\\n: > jesting.  Do you know what pathogens are?  Do you know what \\n: > Point Mutations are?  Do you know that EVERYTHING CAN COME\\n: > ABOUT SPONTANEOUSLY?!!!!!  \\n: \\n: In response to your last statement, no, and neither do you.\\n: You may very well believe that and accept it as fact, but you\\n: cannot *know* that.\\n\\nI hope you don\\'t forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests \\neverything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against\\nthis conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in \\nanything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the \\nright path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so,\\nand not to present one\\'s own conclusions prior to this. \\n\\nTheology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt\\nit could ever come to right conclusions.\\n\\n: >>Human DNA, being more \"complex\", tends to accumulate errors adversely\\n: >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the \\n: >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in \\n: >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence\\n: >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial\\n: >>diseases/disorders.\\n\\nYou are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses\\ndo not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of\\na general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators\\nfrom degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to \\nsurvive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn\\'t make it \\nto the present. \\n\\nAnd for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that\\nhuman DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have\\nclaimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection,\\nand thus are bound to degrade. I haven\\'t seen much evidence for either\\nclaim.\\n \\n: But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in\\n: answering John\\'s question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases,\\n: and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require\\n: babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God\\'s fault? (the original\\n: question) -- I say no, it is not.\\n\\nOf course, nothing \"evil\" is god\\'s fault.  But your explanation does\\nnot work, it fails miserably.\\n \\n: You may be right.  But the fact is that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan is not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills\\n: that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is,\\nit seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are\\njust as inevitable as any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actually what you\\'ve done is to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumably by God) \"to be\\n: punished by getting diseases\".  Why I did say is that free moral\\n: choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject\\n: God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not\\n: expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic\\n: universe.\\n\\nI am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone.\\nI would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed\\nfree. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer\\nis not as clear-cut as it seems to be.\\n\\nWhat consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?\\n  \\n: Oh, I admit it\\'s not perfect (yet).  But I\\'m working on it.  :)\\n\\nA good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.\\n\\n: What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the\\n: question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are\\n: fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain\\n: *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don\\'t explain\\n: the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.\\n\\nWhy is there a \"why behind\"? And your proposition was something\\nthat is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend\\nthese books.\\n\\nIs there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence\\nfor this? If the whole universe can come into existence without\\nany intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al)\\nsuggest, why do people still insist on this?\\n \\n: Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am\\n: not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details\\n: of biology and genetics, although I\\'m sure I\\'d find it a\\n: fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do\\n: not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the\\n: beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its\\n: environment.\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, but they do.

Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois.\\nEnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in\\nmatters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our\\nenvironment.\\n \\nIncorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and\\ninitial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to\\nCritz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and\\nObjectives:\\n \\n                           MISSION\\n \\n   It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members\\n   to foster and implement the improved education of young\\n   people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards\\n   of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition\\n   than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible,\\n   moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue\\n   the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall\\n   seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the\\n   separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation,\\n   improvement, and responsible use of the environment in\\n   which we must all live.\\n \\n                         OBJECTIVES\\n \\n   In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary\\n   objectives shall be:\\n       (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many\\n            environmentally concerned organizations as\\n            possible, said Movement having as its primary\\n            focus the education and participatory\\n            involvement of young people in appropriate areas\\n            of environmental concern;\\n       (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and\\n            their branches a full complement of program\\n            materials for their use, including suitable\\n            uniforms, insignia and other badges, written\\n            ideas, syllabi and information, literature and\\n            other items as shall seem appropriate and\\n            desirable;\\n       (3)  To serve as a \"clearing house\" for the exchange\\n            of program ideas, materials and information\\n            among said organizations;  and\\n       (4)  To assist environmentally concerned\\n            organizations to recruit and train the necessary\\n            adult leadership for their youth programs.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate through three \"Program Divisions\" serving youth in\\nthe elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be\\nthrough formation of \"EnviroLeague Teams,\" either by EnviroLeague itself or by\\nenvironmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a\\ncharter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.\\n \\nEnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders\\nof each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to\\nmembership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper\\nconduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain\\nadditional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such\\norganizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as\\npossible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to\\nyouth membership.\\n \\nEnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to\\ncontribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its\\nTeams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any\\nlocal administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be\\ninvolved in similar functions at the national level.\\n \\nProgram materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the \"draft\"\\nportions of the Mentor\\'s Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the\\nEARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes\\nplace.\\n \\nCompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague\\'s founder chose this\\nelectronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation.\\nThis announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH\\nForums.\\n \\nThe electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe\\'s Earth Forum - GO\\nEARTH - message and library areas 17, both named \"EnviroLeague.\"\\n============================================================================\\n \\nSubsequently, EnviroLeague\\'s Initial Governance Council has held its first\\nmeeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian\\n(equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home\\n(309) 675-4483 in case of real need.

       "  'Tony-\\n\\nI read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other\\ntypical\"Christian\" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"findings\" concerning African-Americans that\\nhave been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias\\nagainst African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,\\nbut there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.\\nFortunately African-Americans had \"whites\" who supported their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was\\neven a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws\\nwere put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,\\nthat is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)\\nopenly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,\\nincluding gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation\\nand making disciples.  We believe in the Lord\\'s great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular\\nto do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes\\nin the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-pressed to find many who actually\\nsho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially\\nwithin their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists\\nagainst the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and\\ntreated as runaway slaves for being \"nigger-lovers\" and such.  I guess I\\'ve\\ndecided the challenge is worth it.\\n\\nIn my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject\\ntheir gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0\\nraged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values\\nCoalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more\\noppressive legisation against gays.\\n\\nPerhaps you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Ages and the proclaimed God\\'s will be done as they massacred thousands\\nin witch hunts and inquisitions.\\n\\nThe message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay\\nrights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even\\nhatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. This is\\nsure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that calls people \"just as they are.\"  Sure there are things that\\nwill \\'naturally\\' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that\\nneed to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things\\nlike left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is\\ngoing to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\'s expectations.\" In the process this coerced conformity causes many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have\\nnothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThis is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with\\nsomething very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedrooms.  It\\'s funny that most straight people have successfully\\nremoved restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it\\nhelps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminals.\\n\\nAnother interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\'s pastors arrested for self-\\nadmitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently\\nbeen going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were\\nvoluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that\\nwas how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing\\nhappen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends\\nrecently told me he was \"approached\" by someone who is going through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for\\ndinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and\\ncreating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in\\nColorado has created an organization who\\'s posters are appearing all over\\nColorado called \"S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\nis \"Working for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThis is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are\\nembracing.\\n\\nWe Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntowards those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of\\nexcluding people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\'s books and find them quite helpful,\\nespecially concerning \\'cults.\\' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto\\nitself.

If I\\n: |> take your usage of the term, homophobe, in the sense you seem to\\n: |> intend, then all men are really homosexual and evolution of our\\n: |> species at least, is going nowhere.\\n: |> \\n: \\n: So *every* time a man has sex with a woman they intend to produce children?\\n: Hmm...no wonder the world is overpopulated.  Obviously you keep to the\\n: Monty Python song:  \"Every sperm is sacred\".  And if, as *you* say, it has\\n: a purpose as a means to limit population growth then it is, by your own \\n: arguement, natural.\\n\\nConsider the context, I\\'m talking about an evolutionary function. One\\nof the most basic requirements of evolution is that members of a\\nspecies procreate, those who don\\'t have no purpose in that context.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Another point is that if the offspring of each generation is to\\n: |> survive, the participation of both parents is necessary - a family must\\n: |> exist, since homosexuals do not reproduce, they cannot constitute a\\n: |> family. Since the majority of humankind is part of a family,\\n: |> homosexuality is an evolutionary abberation, contrary to nature if you\\n: |> will.\\n: |> \\n: \\n: Well if that is true, by your own arguements homosexuals would have \\n: vanished *years* ago due to non-procreation.  Also the parent from single\\n: parent families should put the babies out in the cold now, cos they must,\\n: by your arguement, die.\\n\\nBy your argument, homosexuality is genetically determined. As to your\\nsecond point, you prove again that you have no idea what context\\nmeans. I am talking about evolution, the preservation of the species,\\nthe fundamental premise of the whole process.\\n: \\n: |> But it gets worse. Since the overwhelming majority of people actually\\n: |> -prefer- a heterosexual relationship, homosexuality is a social\\n: |> abberation as well. The homosexual eschews the biological imperative\\n: |> to reproduce and then the social imperative to form and participate in\\n: |> the most fundamental social element, the family. But wait, there\\'s\\n: |> more.\\n: |> \\n: \\n: Read the above.  I expect you to have at least ten children by now, with\\n: the family growing.  These days sex is less to do with procreation (admittedly\\n: without it there would be no-one) but more to do with pleasure.  In pre-pill\\n: and pre-condom days, if you had sex there was the chance of producing children.\\n: These days is just ain\\'t true!  People can decide whether or not to have \\n: children and when.  Soon they will be able to choose it\\'s sex &c (but that\\'s \\n: another arguement...) so it\\'s more of a \"lifestyle\" decision.  Again by\\n: your arguement, since homosexuals can not (or choose not) to reproduce they must\\n: be akin to people who decide to have sex but not children.  Both are \\n: as \"unnatural\" as each other.\\n\\nYet another non-sequitur. Sex is an evolutionary function that exists\\nfor procreation, that it is also recreation is incidental. That\\nhomosexuals don\\'t procreate means that sex is -only- recreation and\\nnothing more; they serve no -evolutionary- purpose.\\n\\n: \\n: |> Since homosexuals have come out the closet and have convinced some\\n: |> policy makers that they have civil rights, they are now claiming that\\n: |> their sexuality is a preference, a life-style, an orientation, a\\n: |> choice that should be protected by law. Now if homosexuality is a mere\\n: |> choice and if it is both contrary to nature and anti-social, then it\\n: |> is a perverse choice; they have even less credibility than before they\\n: |> became prominent. \\n: |> \\n: \\n: People are people are people.  Who are you to tell anyone else how to live\\n: their life?  Are you god(tm)?  If so, fancy a date?\\n\\nHere\\'s pretty obvious dodge, do you really think you\\'ve said anything\\nor do you just feel obligated to respond to every statement? I am not\\ntelling anyone anything, I am demonstrating that there are arguments\\nagainst the practice of homosexuality (providing it\\'s a merely an\\nalternate lifestlye) that are not homophobic, that one can reasonably\\ncall it perverse in a context even a atheist can understand. I realize\\nof course that this comes dangerously close to establishing  a value,\\nand that atheists are compelled to object on that basis, but if you\\nare to be consistent, you have no case in this regard.\\n: \\n: |> To characterize any opposition to homosexuality as homophobic is to\\n: |> ignore some very compelling arguments against the legitimization of\\n: |> the homosexual \"life-style\". But since the charge is only intended to\\n: |> intimidate, it\\'s really just demogoguery and not to be taken\\n: |> seriously. Fact is, Jim, there are far more persuasive arguments for\\n: |> suppressing homosexuality than those given, but consider this a start.\\n: |> \\n: \\n: Again crap.  All your arguments are based on outdated ideals.  Likewise the\\n: bible.  Would any honest Christian condemn the ten generations spawned by\\n: a \"bastard\" to eternal damnation?  Or someone who crushes his penis (either\\n: accidently or not..!).  Both are in Deuteronomy.\\n\\nI\\'m sure your comment pertains to something, but you\\'ve disguised it\\nso well I can\\'t see what. Where did I mention ideals, out-dated or\\notherwise? Your arguments are very reactionary; do you have anything\\nat all to contribute?\\n\\n: \\n: |> As to why homosexuals should be excluded from participation in\\n: |> scouting, the reasons are the same as those used to restrict them from\\n: |> teaching; by their own logic, homosexuals are deviates, social and\\n: |> biological.

       "  'I am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program,\\n   an INTERACTIVE, FULL COLOR image viewer and editor based on SGI GL.\\n   Besides typical touchup tasks, such as crop, rotate, smooth, etc,\\n   bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs,\\n   such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image.\\n\\n   The following is the relevant sections from the man page. \\n   -----------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nPre-Release of May, 1993                                       BIT(1L)\\n\\nNAME\\n   bit - Bitmap Image Touchup for SGI Workstations\\n\\nDESCRIPTION\\n  bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on\\n  Silicon Graphics GL. As a full color program, bit handles images of both\\n  24bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner.\\n\\n  As an image viewer, bit allows list of images to be displayed in their\\n  original type (24bits or color index) in any order and in any of the\\n  many built-in styles of display. You can walk up and down the list using\\n  mouse and keyboard, or you can let bit do the walk for you (The\\n  SlideShow).  With the pan and zoom features, large images can be viewed\\n  in full without being limited by the window or screen size.\\n\\n  As an image editor, bit performs a large number of image editing and\\n  processing tasks accurately and efficiently. It keeps information loss\\n  at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing\\n  subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type\\n  whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and/or quantization of\\n  input images. You can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into\\n  another.  In addition, arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple\\n  geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with\\n  the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take\\n  advantage of the higher printer resolutions (e.g. PostScript).\\n\\n  Bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing\\n  image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence\\n  turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be\\n  accessed by a press of a button, and best of all, the processed image\\n  will be read back and displayed immediately. Convolution using exter-\\n  nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically\\n  giving great flexibility in processing an image.\\n\\nFEATURES\\n\\n  Bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a\\n  continuous progress report, and once the processing is complete, \\n  the processed image will be displayed.\\n\\n  Current features include\\n\\n  o Rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti-aliasing\\n    and filling the \"rotated out\" region with an arbitrary color.\\n\\n  o Scales an image by arbitrary factors in x- and/or y-directions with\\n    the option of subpixel sampling.\\n\\n  o Renders text of arbitrary color, size or orientation on top of an\\n    image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving\\n    the text and raster separately, such as into a PostScript file, to\\n    take advantage of a higher printer resolution. Besides normal text\\n    strings, many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as\\n    in TeX(1), e.g., $\\\\alpha$\\\\small$\\\\beta$ produces Greek alphabet alpha\\n    followed by a slightly smaller Greek alphabet beta.\\n\\n  o Presents graphically the histogram of an image.\\n\\n  o Performs arbitrary 1-to-1 pixel transformation.  The transformation\\n    function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary\\n    forms. Further, the transformation can be applied to RGB channels\\n    separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of\\n    it. Many difficult tasks, such as thresholding, can be accomplished\\n    rather easily by 1-to-1 transformation in combination with the avai-\\n    lability of graphical histograms of the image.\\n\\n  o Places simple geometric figures (SGFs), e.g., arrows, circles, trian-\\n    gles etc., of arbitrary color, size and orientation into an image at\\n    arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some\\n    user definable coordinate system units, with the option of rendering\\n    directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately (e.g,\\n    PostScript file). All SGFs can be scaled in x- and y-directions\\n    independently or simultaneously (this is how to get an ellipse from a\\n    circle).\\n\\n  o Performs edge detection. In combination with image histograms and 1-\\n    to-1 transformation, very accurate result can be obtained.\\n\\n  o Performs histogram equalization.\\n\\n  o Performs convolution with externally defined (square) matrices of\\n    arbitrary order.\\n\\n  o Crops a rectangular portion of an image.\\n\\n  o Cuts and pastes across images.\\n\\n  o Magnifies any portion of an image by any amount.\\n\\n  o Displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause\\n    interval between images. (SlideShow)\\n\\n  o Measures RGB intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels\\n    along an arbitrary line with the result presented as RGB intensities\\n    or as an intensity vs. distance plot.\\n\\n  o Performs image type conversions.\\n\\n  o Converts image formats.\\n\\n  o Smoothes an image (Special convolution).\\n\\n  o Filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image\\n    back and display it.\\n\\n  o Modify an individual pixel\\'s RGB values.\\n\\n  o Performs FFT on the entire image or a portion of it and display the\\n    resulting power spectra.\\n\\n  o Spray and brush paint in full color (unavailable in this pre-release).\\n\\n SUPPORTED FORMATS\\n      o  IRIS RGB, native to SGI IRIS\\n      o  JPEG(JFIF) format\\n      o  CompuServ GIF\\n      o  PNM(Portable Any Map), including PPM, PGM and PBM.\\n      o  XBM (X Window Bitmap)\\n      o  TIFF\\n      o  PostScript(Write only)\\n\\nHardware requirements:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   Any SGI workstation that supports RGBmode(), including indigoes.\\n\\nWhere to get it:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   anonymous ftp to monte.svec.uh.edu   /pub/bit/bitxxx.tar.Z\\n   where xxx is the version number. Current version is 0.73\\n\\n   Read src/01Readme for installation instructions after unpacking\\n\\nAcknowledgement:\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n   JPEG support is based on the Independent JPEG groups\\'s library Version 4.\\n   FORMS library, developed by Mark Overmars, is used for GUI.\\n   Both JPEG and FORMS library are included in this release.\\n\\n---------------------------------------------------------------\\n  Bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate\\n  images; The built-in editing features will satisfy most of\\n  your editing needs.

       "  'This discussion on \"objective\" seems to be falling into solipsism (Eg: the\\nrecent challenge from Frank Dwyer, for someone to prove that he can actually\\nobserve phenomena).  Someones even made the statement that science is\\n\"subjective\" and that even atom are \"subjective.\" This is getting a bit silly\\nand the word \"objective\" is losing all meaning.  Lets start by remembering the\\ndefinition of \"objective\" which has been already presented:\\n\\n  objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as \\n    distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existence.\\n    3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on\\n    observable phenomenon.\\n\\nThe Objectivity of a thing is not based on whether everyone agrees on that\\nthing (eg: the world is objectively round, regardless of the fact that there\\nexist flat earthers), but rather whether it is based observable and verifiable\\nphenomenon (instead of being based solely on peoples wishes, feeling, mental\\nprocesses, etc).  Thus atoms, being based on very observable and repeatable\\nphenomenon, are indeed considered to be objective rather than subjective. \\nEven weird, high energy physics is based on observable phenomenon (even though\\nthat observation can change the outcome).  Nor are those observable phenomenon\\naffected by emotion, or personal prejudice (eg: chemical reactions do not\\nchange to the whims of different people).  Thus to say that science is not\\nobjective (ie: objectively verifiable) is a bit silly, as that is the\\npoint of science.  Now I will agree that science is not objectively \"good;\" I\\nwill not thereby conclude though that science is not objective. \\n\\nNow some examples things which are \"objective\":  A D-12 tractor is larger\\nthan the average breadbox.  Chlorophyll is green.  Seawater contains salt.\\nThere exists ozone in the atmosphere (at least presently).  Ozone blocks \\nultraviolet light.  Ultraviolet light increases the incidents of skin Cancer.\\n\\n\"Good\" on the other hand is a value judgement.  It doesn\\'t seem to have an\\nexistence apart from what we give it (unless someone can objectively show the\\nexistence of an omnipotent entity which has defined \"good\").  We cannot\\nquantify it, touch it or collect it in any concrete sense (eg: I have a bag\\nfull of \"good\").  Now we do sometimes attempt to give the word \"good\" an\\nobjective meaning, e.g.  \"good\" has been used to denote strength, resiliency,\\nspeed, etc.  That though, is a subjective definition, as some might not see\\n\"strength\" and etc, as necessarily \"good\" (eg: strength inspired by Naziism \\nis not generally viewed as \"good\"). \\n\\nAs to a morality, I cannot say that I have ever seen a morality strictly based\\non verifiable observable phenomenon.  The closest I have seen is some form of\\nthe \"Golden Rule,\" which concludes that it is best not to deliberately piss\\npeople off, as they will likely then involve themselves in your life, in a\\nmanner you won\\'t like.  This is verifiable; when you \"get in someone\\'s face,\"\\nthey will often retaliate.  Another objective fact about morality is that a\\nmore powerful group can enforce their morality on a weaker group, and thus can\\nat times, ignore that form of the \"Golden Rule\" without fear of reprisal.  Now\\nas to whether this enforcing of morality is \"good\" or \"bad,\" is quite\\nsubjective.  By the way, remember that subjective does not mean that a thing\\ncannot be formally stated, or even commonly agreed upon; it only means that\\nthat it is not verifiable from observable phenomena, or has a physical\\nexistence unto itself.  Also note that I have not stated that there is no such\\nthing as an objective morality, or that I could not accept any such a\\nmorality; I have simply stated that I have seen no evidence of any such\\nmorality. \\n\\nOne other thing to notice, \"objective\" is many times used as synonymous with\\n\"true\" and/or \"absolute,\" and \"subjective\" sometimes has the connotation of\\n\"false\" and/or \"relative.\" Tain\\'t necessarily so.  For instance, when a\\nconclusion is based on objective, but insufficient evidence, then it can be\\nboth objective and false.  As to \"absolute,\" it is easy to note that while we\\ncan objectively show that TNT is explosive, but that does not absolutely mean\\nthat all TNT will explode, and thus objective is not necessarily absolute\\neither.  On the other hand, something subjective can also be either\\n\"absolutist,\" or \"true.\" For instance, there are some theists who are\\nspecifically \"absolutist\" in their morality, even though they have only\\nsubjective evidence to back it up.  Further, many a scientist and detective\\nhas been motivated by subjective reasons (eg: a \"gut feeling\" or \"hunch\"), to\\ninvestigate a phenomena or situation, and gather the objective evidence\\nnecessary to support a true hypothesis.  On the whole though, I would have to\\nagree that objective evidence is much more trustworthy than subjective\\nevidence.\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler',\n",

       "  '-*----\\n\\n\\nNo.  It follows from the fact that most Christians\\' choice of\\ninterpretation stems from a mix of beliefs that are influenced by\\nthe secular ethics of their culture and that are not fully\\ndetermined by scripture.  Whether or not there is some \"right\"\\ninterpretation matters not; few Christians claim the ability to\\nread the mind of their god.  Dave Davis should note that it was\\nMichael who first stated the importance of secular and cultural\\ninfluence in this thread.  I think Michael is right in this, but\\nregardless, it should be noted that this has *not* been a point\\nof contention between Michael and myself. \\n\\nI have argued -- beyond Michael\\'s claims -- that the Christian\\nscriptures are open to so many interpretations -- including a\\nwide divergence within the Christian tradition -- that even their\\nmost important themes are vague.  Again, it does not matter that\\nthere is some \"right\" interpretation *unless* there is a way to\\ndetermine what that \"right\" interpretation is.  It is the lack of\\nan objective measure, not the presumed lack of an answer, that\\nputs the force behind the line I argue.\\n\\n\\nThere are enough Christian glasses, varying over a sufficiently\\nbroad range of color, that I can find a few that support my\\nexample. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn my opinion, what makes Michael radical is that he fully\\nacknowledges that Christian scripture and tradition fail to\\ndetermine the doctrines that so many branches within Christianity\\nhold dear.  He is willing to live and practice his religion\\nwithin this indeterminacy, and he is willing to acknowledge that\\nmuch of his understanding of things Christian is influenced by\\nideas that are not purely Christian.  Those Christians I have\\ncalled conservative must also interpret, but they do not\\nrecognize -- or at least, are unwilling to admit -- the extent and\\nimportance of this.\\n\\n\\nI recognize that Michael is part of the tradition.  But what does\\nit tell one about a tradition covering Origen, Aquinas, Jerry\\nFallwell, and Jesse Jackson that it also includes Michael Siemon?\\nNot very much!\\n\\n\\n\\nI think the conclusion does follow.  The purely Christian\\nprinciples that Michael has are the ones he shares with others in\\nthe Christian tradition or that can be derived from Christian\\nscripture.  These, necessarily vague, are not enough to drive his\\npolitical stances.  That one should love one\\'s neighbor is a \\npurely Christian principle.  That this means showing tolerance \\nfor homosexuality is *not*.\\n\\nAs to these political stances, they are often at odds with what\\nis commonly held in most of current Christendom, and so I \\nsuspect they could be better pressed outside it.  (On the other\\nhand, I can well understand the counterpoint, that these \\npolitical stances become most influential when presented to \\nthose who need them most.)\\n\\n-*----\\n\\nHaving barely survived the effort to finish in computer science, I\\ndoubt I will attempt a more difficult field any time soon!',\n",

First let me say that when I say \"intelligent\"\\nI mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level\\nwith, or greater than, human tool use and tool building. IE assuming\\nsuitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter \\nit\\'s enviroment in a planned way, it will do so. That\\'s certainly not\\na universal or complete definition of intelligence, but it will suffice\\nfor a putative technological alien.\\n\\nNow no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought, but\\nit\\'s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level\\nof complexity. This is generally determined by the number of neuron\\ncells, and their interconnections. So a creature the size of a lemur\\nwouldn\\'t have enough neurons to support complex thought. This argument\\nis considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur. There\\'s room\\nfor a large brain, though no indication that one ever developed. One\\nreason this may be true is neuronic speed. The electrochemical messages \\nthat trigger neurons require time to propagate. This makes it difficult\\nfor a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very\\nlarge creatures. So there\\'s little selection pressure for such brains.\\nInstead, a simpler distributed network evolves. This doesn\\'t rule out\\nintelligent dinosaurs, but it points in that direction.\\n\\nThen there are the thermodynamic arguments. A tiny creature like the\\nlemur needs to eat frequently because it\\'s internal heat is rapidly\\nlost due to it\\'s high surface to volume ratio. I contend that a creature\\nthat must spend most of it\\'s time and energy feeding won\\'t have the time\\nto develop and exercise intelligence. That argument may be somewhat weak.\\nThe dinosaur\\'s problem is the reverse, it must moderate it\\'s heat production \\nbecause it\\'s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat. \\nI\\'m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical\\nreactivity reasons for productive neuron function. So creatures would\\ntend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that\\nof humans if they are carbon based. That tends to rule out cold blooded\\ncreatures as potential homes of intelligence. Some people contend that\\nsome of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded. But for a creature\\nthe size of a brontosaur, it\\'s activity levels would have to be restrained\\nor it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the\\nwaste heat. Whales are similar size, but they can reject heat to the\\nocean, a much more efficient sink than air. I suspect that for intelligence\\nto manifest itself, a certain degree of activity in interacting with the\\nenvironment is necessary. IE monkey curiousity. I doubt a large dinosaur\\nwould be capable of that much activity.\\n\\nGary',\n",

Science is not based on and does not consist of \"quotes\" from either\\n    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)\\n    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive\\n    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike\\n    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to\\n    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests\\n    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they\\n    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his\\n    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the\\n    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.\\n    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context\\n    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate\\n    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may\\n    not be your real intent.\\n\\n    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of \"the modern theory of\\n    evolution\" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one\\n    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that\\n    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate\\n    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck\\n    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond\\n    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not\\n    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.\\n\\n    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack\\n    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on\\n    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the\\n    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long\\n    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and\\n    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a\\n    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.\\n\\n\\nWarren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:\\n\\n * Neither I, nor Webster\\'s has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *\\n\\n  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster\\'s B^).  Francis Hitchings\\nis a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the\\npart of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (\"The Neck of\\nthe Giraffe\").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)\\nusing the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could\\nnot have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution\\n(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a \"non sequitur\" (i.e.\\nthe conclusion \"does not follow\"). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard\\nLewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]\\n\\n  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber\\nin the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was\\ntitled \"`Giraffe\\' sticks scientific neck out too far\".  Excerpts include :\\n\\n  \"Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.\"  \"He goes after Darwin like Mark\\n  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and\\n  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.\"  \"He suggests\\n  a mystical `organizing principle\\' of life, using the similarity of organs\\n  in different creatures as evidence [sic].\"\\n\\n  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not\\nagainst it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn\\'t\\nsurprise me much.  It\\'s also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.\\nhe only posted a quote).\\n',\n",

There is widespread folklore, but no good documentary\\nevidence, or even solid rumor, concerning the deaths of the Apostles.\\nFurther, the usual context of such arguments, as you observe, is \"No\\nMartyrs for a Lie\": i.e. the willingness of these people to die rather\\nthan recant is evidence for the truth of their belief.  This adds the\\nquite stronger twist that the proposed martyrs must have been offered\\nthe chance of life by recanting.  Since we don\\'t even know how or\\nwhere they died, we certainly don\\'t have this information.

I have provided an\\nargument that almost everyone senses that Freedom is valuable - the\\nonly cogent objection to this came from jon livesey, and was offered\\nby some other people too: essentially, that people disagree about\\nfuzzy concepts such as Freedom.  It\\'s a good point, and I\\'m thinking\\nabout it.\\n# \\n#Your trick is to say, I feel A is not right, and so do many I know,\\n#therefore A is absolutely right. It neglects the possibility that\\n#these people consider A to be right as an effect of the same process,\\n#restricting the claim of its absoluteness to those who have been subject\\n#of that process. In other words, refutes it. You make the ontological\\n#claim, you have to prove it.\\n\\nNonsense.  My \"trick\" is to say:  I feel that A is better than B and so \\ndoes almost any disinterested person I ask.  Best evidence is therefore \\nthat A really is better than B, subject to the assumption that we\\ncan establish to our mutual satisfaction what we mean by A and B, and\\nthat the resulting system of values is self-consistent.\\n\\nNow get this:  \"really is better\" is an idealisation, a fictional model,\\nin the same sense that \"real material existence\" is a fictional model. It\\nmay or may not correspond to something true.  It is nonetheless a useful\\n_assumption_.  Far more useful than the equally assumed relativist \\n\"trick\", to wit:\\n\\nI feel that A is better than B, and so does almost any disinterested person\\nI ask.  However, if even one person disagrees that A is better than B,\\nor if even one person dissents from mutually agreed definitions of A and B,\\nthen it is the case that B is better than A for that person, and nothing\\nmore can be said.  \\n\\nI say this is useless because it inexorably implies that a supermajority\\nseeking to maximise A cannot morally take action against someone seeking to\\nmaximise B (e.g. a terrorist).  To do that would be to claim that \\na supermajority\\'s carefully considered morality would be better than the \\nterrorist\\'s - which would, of course, be true, but a no-no for an ethical\\nrelativist.  To claim that ethical relativism implies anything else is\\nsimply weasel words, and an example of compartmentalisation to rival\\nanything in the world of religion.\\n\\n#>#For a similar argument, I sense morality is subjective, it does not\\n#>#hurt me to do things that are considered to be objectively wrong by\\n#>#others.\\n#>\\n#>If you mean that you do things that some others consider objectively\\n#>wrong, and it turns out not to be the case for you - of course this\\n#>is possible.

Aboard those boosters were a new breed of VENERA probe \\n    for the planet Venus. \\n\\n        Designated VENERA 15 and 16, the probes were meant not for landing\\n    yet more spherical craft on the Venerean surface but to radar map the\\n    planet in detail from orbit.  To accomplish this task, the basic\\n    VENERA design was modified in numerous areas.  The central bus core\\n    was made one meter (39.37 inches) longer to carry the two tons of\\n    propellant required for braking into orbit, double the fuel carried by\\n    the VENERA 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier.  Extra solar panels\\n    were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large\\n    amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging.  The\\n    dish-shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger \\n    to properly transmit this information to Earth. \\n\\n        Atop the buses, where landers were usually placed, were installed\\n    the 1.4 by 6-meter (4.62 by 19.8-foot), 300-kilogram (660-pound)\\n    POLYUS V side-looking radar antennae.  The radar system, possibly a\\n    terrain-imaging version of the nuclear-powered satellites used by \\n    the Soviets for Earth ocean surveillance, would be able to map Venus\\'\\n    surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers (0.62 to 1.2 miles). \\n\\n        The Soviet probes\\' imaging parameters were a vast improvement over\\n    the United States PIONEER VENUS Orbiter, which could reveal objects \\n    no smaller than 75 kilometers (45 miles) in diameter.  And while the\\n    VENERAs\\' resolution was comparable to that of similar observations \\n    made by the 300-meter (1,000-foot) Arecibo radio telescope on the \\n    island of Puerto Rico, the orbiters would be examining the northern\\n    pole of Venus.  This region was unobtainable by either Arecibo or \\n    PIONEER VENUS and appeared to contain a number of potentially \\n    interesting geological features worthy of investigation.\\n\\n        On October 10, 1983, after an interplanetary journey of 330 \\n    million kilometers (198 million miles) and two mid-course corrections, \\n    VENERA 15 fired its braking rockets over Venus to place itself in a \\n    polar orbit 1,000 by 65,000 kilometers (600 by 39,000 miles) around \\n    the planet, completing one revolution every twenty-four hours.  VENERA \\n    16 followed suit four days later.  The twin probes thus became Venus\\' \\n    first polar-circling spacecraft.\\n\\n        Radar operations began on October 16 for VENERA 15 and October 20 \\n    for VENERA 16.  For up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north\\n    pole, the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers \\n    (ninety miles) wide and nine thousand kilometers (5,400 miles) long.  \\n    The craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over \\n    the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back \\n    to two large Soviet antennae on Earth.  Each strip of information took \\n    eight hours to process by computer.  By the end of their main missions \\n    in July of 1984, the VENERAs had mapped 115 million square kilometers \\n    (46 million square miles), thirty percent of the entire planet.\\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 revealed that Venus has a surface geology more\\n    complex than shown by PIONEER VENUS in the late 1970s.  Numerous hills, \\n    mountains, ridges, valleys, and plains spread across the landscape, \\n    many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the \\n    last one billion years.  In planetary terms this makes the Venerean \\n    surface rather young.  Hundreds of craters were detected as well, the \\n    largest of which had to have been created by meteorites (planetoids \\n    would be a better term here) at least fourteen kilometers (8.4 miles) \\n    across, due to Venus\\' very dense atmosphere.\\n\\n        There were some disagreements between U.S. and Soviet scientists\\n    on the origins of certain surface features.  For example, the probes\\' \\n    owners declared that the 96-kilometer (57.6-mile) wide crater at the \\n    summit of 10,800-meter (35,640-foot) high Maxwell Montes, the tallest \\n    mountain on the planet, was the result of a meteorite impact.  American \\n    scientists, on the other hand, felt the crater was proof that Maxwell \\n    was a huge volcano sitting on the northern \"continent\" of Ishtar Terra.  \\n\\n        In any event, the U.S. decided to wait on making verdicts about\\n    Venus until the arrival of their own radar probe, scheduled for later\\n    in the decade.  Originally named the Venus Orbiting Imaging Radar\\n    (VOIR), its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig-\\n    nated the Venus Radar Mapper (VRM).  Eventually the machine would be \\n    called MAGELLAN, after the Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan \\n    (circa 1480-1521).  This vehicle would map the entire planet in even \\n    finer detail than the VENERAs.  For the time, however, the Soviet \\n    probes maintained that distinction.\\n\\n        Radar imaging was not the only ability of the VENERAs.  Bolted\\n    next to the POLYUS V radar antenna were the Omega altimeter and the \\n    Fourier infrared spectrometer, the latter for measuring the world\\'s\\n    temperatures.  The majority of the areas covered registered about\\n    five hundred degrees Celsius (932 degrees Fahrenheit), but a few\\n    locations were two hundred degrees hotter, possibly indicating \\n    current volcanic activity.  The probes also found that the clouds \\n    over the poles were five to eight kilometers (three to 4.8 miles) \\n    lower than at the equator.  In contrast, the polar air above sixty \\n    kilometers (thirty-six miles) altitude was five to twenty degrees \\n    warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights.\\n\\n        When the main mapping mission ended in July of 1984, there were \\n    plans for at least one of the VENERAs to radar image the surface at \\n    more southernly latitudes.  Unfortunately this idea did not come to \\n    pass, as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude-control\\n    gas to perform the operation.  \\n\\n        VENERA 15 and 16 ceased transmission in March of 1985, leaving \\n    the Soviet Institute of Radiotechnology and Electronics with six \\n    hundred kilometers (360 miles) of radar data tape to sort into an \\n    atlas of twenty-seven maps of the northern hemisphere of Venus.\\n\\n        Venus by Balloon\\n\\n        For years the thick atmosphere of Venus had been a tempting \\n    target to scientists who wished to explore the planet\\'s mantle of \\n    air with balloon-borne instruments.  Professor Jacques Blamont of \\n    the French space agency Centre National d\\'Etudes Spatiales (CNES)\\n    had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967, only to have a joint \\n    French-Soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982.  Nevertheless, \\n    late in the year 1984, such dreams would eventually come true.\\n\\n        When two PROTON rockets were sent skyward on December 15 and 21, \\n    the Soviet Union provided Western observers with the first clear, full \\n    views of the booster which had been launching every Soviet Venus probe \\n    since 1975.  This was but one of many firsts for the complex mission.\\n\\n        The unmanned probes launched into space that December were named\\n    VEGA 1 and 2, a contraction of the words VENERA and GALLEI - Gallei\\n    being the Russian word for Halley.  Not only did the spacecraft \\n    have more than one mission to perform, they also had more than one \\n    celestial objective to explore, namely the comet Halley.  \\n\\n        This famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to \\n    the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910.\\n    Since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from\\n    the formation of the solar system five billion years ago, scientists \\n    around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such \\n    bodies which actually come close to Earth.  \\n\\n        Most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar \\n    system.  Some, like Halley, are perturbed by various forces and fall \\n    in towards the Sun, where they circle for millennia spewing out ice \\n    and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar \\n    encounter.\\n\\n        The Soviet Union, along with the European Space Agency (ESA) and\\n    Japan\\'s Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS), did not\\n    wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a\\n    close examination of Halley.  The ESA would be using the cylindrical\\n    GIOTTO probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the \\n    comet, while Japan\\'s first deep space craft - SAKIGAKE (Pioneer) and \\n    SUISEI (Comet) - would view Halley from a much safer distance. \\n\\n        Scientists in the United States also desired to study the comet\\n    from the vantage of a space probe, at one time envisioning a vessel\\n    powered by solar sails or ion engines.  However, government budget\\n    cuts to NASA canceled the American efforts.  The U.S. would have to\\n    make do primarily with Earth-based observations and the sharing of \\n    data from other nations, though an instrument named the Dust Counter \\n    and Mass Analyzer (DUCMA), designed by Chicago University Professor \\n    John Simpson, was added on the Soviet mission in May of 1984.\\n\\n        The Soviets\\' answer to Halley were the VEGAs.  Instead of building\\n    an entirely new craft for the mission, the Soviets decided to modify\\n    their VENERA bus design to encounter the comet while performing an \\n    advanced Venus mission along the way.  As VEGA 1 and 2 reached Venus,\\n    the buses would drop off one lander/balloon each and use the mass of \\n    the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet Halley, much as the \\n    U.S. probe MARINER 10 used Venus to flyby Mercury eleven years earlier. \\n    The Soviet craft would then head on to Halley, helping to pinpoint the \\n    location of the comet\\'s erupting nucleus for the GIOTTO probe to dive \\n    in only 605 kilometers (363 miles) away in March of 1986.\\n\\n        As planned, the two VEGAs arrived at Venus in June of 1985.  VEGA\\n    1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month, the lander\\n    making a two-day descent towards the planet.  The craft touched the\\n    upper atmosphere on the morning of June 11.  Sixty-one kilometers\\n    (36.6 miles) above the Venerean surface a small container was released\\n    by the lander, which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers (33 miles)\\n    altitude.  Thus the first balloon probe ever to explore Venus had\\n    successfully arrived. \\n\\n        One kilometer after the opening of the parachute, helium gas was\\n    pumped into the Teflon-coated plastic balloon, inflating it to a\\n    diameter of 3.54 meters (11.68 feet).  Dangling on a tether thirteen\\n    meters (42.9 feet) below was the instrument package, properly known as\\n    an aerostat.  The top part of the 6.9-kilogram (15.18-pound) aerostat\\n    consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment\\n    point to the balloon.  Beneath it was the transmitter, electronics,\\n    and instruments.  Connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for\\n    measuring cloud particles.  The aerostat was painted with a special\\n    white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which\\n    permeated the planet\\'s atmosphere. \\n\\n        The VEGA 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of Venus just\\n    north of the equator.  Scientists were concerned that the gas bag \\n    would burst in the heat of daylight, so they placed it in the darkened \\n    hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data.  \\n    This action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as \\n    well, effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions.  \\n    The author wonders, though, if they could have used floodlights similar \\n    to the ones attached to VENERA 9 and 10 in 1975, when Soviet scientists \\n    had thought the planet\\'s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight \\n    due to the permanently thick cloud cover.\\n\\n        The first balloon transmitted for 46.5 hours right into the day\\n    hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed, covering 11,600\\n    kilometers (6,960 miles).  The threat of bursting in the day heat did\\n    not materialize.  The VEGA 1 balloon was stationed at a 54-kilometer\\n    (32.4-mile) altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers\\n    (thirty miles), for this was considered the most active of the three\\n    main cloud layers reported by PIONEER VENUS in 1978.  Indeed the\\n    balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers\\n    (150 miles) per hour.  Strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and\\n    down two to three hundred meters (660 to 990 feet) through most of the\\n    journey.  The layer\\'s air temperature averaged forty degrees Celsius\\n    (104 degrees Fahrenheit) and pressure was a mere 0.5 Earth atmosphere.\\n    The nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds. \\n\\n        Early in the first balloon\\'s flight, the VEGA 1 lander was already\\n    headed towards the Venerean surface.  Both landers were equipped with\\n    a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on VENERA 13 \\n    and 14 in 1982.  However, VEGA 1 would become unable to report the\\n    composition of the ground at its landing site in Rusalka Planitia, the\\n    Mermaid Plain north of Aphrodite Terra.  While still ten to fifteen\\n    minutes away from landing, a timer malfunction caused the drill to \\n    accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers (9.6 \\n    miles) above the surface. \\n\\n        There was neither any way to shut off the instrument before\\n    touchdown nor reactivate it after landing.  This was unfortunate not\\n    only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of\\n    Venus was covered with such smooth low-level lava plains and had never \\n    before been directly examined.  Nevertheless, the surface temperature \\n    and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees Celsius (874.4 degrees \\n    Fahrenheit) and 95 Earth atmospheres respectively during the lander\\'s \\n    56 minutes of ground transmissions.  A large amount of background \\n    infrared radiation was also recorded at the site.\\n\\n        As had been done when the drills and cameras on VENERA 11 and \\n    12 had failed in December of 1978, the Soviets focused on the data\\n    returned during the lander\\'s plunge through the atmosphere.  The\\n    French-Soviet Malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur, chlorine, \\n    and possibly phosphorus.  It is the sulfur - possibly from active \\n    volcanoes - which gives the Venerean clouds their yellowish color.\\n    The Sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air\\n    between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers (28.8 and 37.8 miles)\\n    contained one milligram (0.015 grain) of sulfuric acid.\\n\\n        The VEGA 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks \\n    appeared to be at odds with the information from PIONEER VENUS.\\n    The case was made even stronger by the fact that VEGA 2\\'s results\\n    nearly matched its twin.  The VEGAs found only two main cloud layers \\n    instead of the three reported by the U.S. probes.  The layers were \\n    three to five kilometers (1.8 to 3 miles) thick at altitudes of 50 \\n    and 58 kilometers (30 and 34.8 miles).  The clouds persisted like a\\n    thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers (21 miles), \\n    much lower than the PV readings.  One possibility for the discrepan-\\n    cies may have been radical structural changes in the Venerean air \\n    over the last seven years.\\n\\n        When the lander and balloon finally went silent, the last \\n    functioning part of the VEGA 1 mission, the flyby bus, sailed on\\n    for a 708 million-kilometer (424.8 million-mile) journey around\\n    the Sun to become the first probe to meet comet Halley.  On March\\n    6, 1986, the bus made a 8,890-kilometer (5,334-mile) pass at the \\n    dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space.\\n    The Soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial\\n    bodies with one space vessel.\\n\\n        On June 13, VEGA 2 released its lander/balloon payload for\\n    a two-day fall towards Venus.  Like its duplicate, the VEGA 2\\n    balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking\\n    it on Earth for 46.5 hours before battery failure on the morning\\n    side of the planet.  During its 11,100-kilometer (6,660-mile)\\n    flight over Venus, the second balloon entered in a rather still\\n    environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission.\\n    After 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent \\n    for a further eight hours.  When the balloon passed over a five-\\n    kilometer (three-mile) mountain on the \"continent\" of Aphrodite \\n    Terra, a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2.5 kilometers (1.5 \\n    miles) towards the surface.\\n\\n        Temperature sensors on the VEGA 2 balloon reported that the air \\n    layer it was moving through was consistently 6.5 degrees Celsius \\n    (43.7 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than the area explored by the VEGA 1\\n    balloon.  This was corroborated by the VEGA 2 lander as it passed \\n    through the balloon\\'s level.  No positive indications of lightning\\n    were made by either balloon, and the second aerostat\\'s nephelometer \\n    failed to function.\\n\\n        The VEGA 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of Aphrodite\\n    Terra\\'s western arm on the fifteenth of June, 1,500 kilometers (900\\n    miles) southeast of VEGA 1.  The lander\\'s resting place was smoother\\n    than thought, indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a\\n    relatively young one covered in fresh lava.  The soil drill was in\\n    working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite-troctolite, \\n    rare on Earth but present in Luna\\'s highlands.  This rock is rich in \\n    aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium.  A high degree \\n    of sulfur was also present in the soil.  The air around VEGA 2 measured \\n    463 degrees Celsius (865.4 degrees Fahrenheit) and 91 Earth atmospheres,\\n    essentially a typical day (or night) on Venus.\\n\\n        Far above the VEGA 2 lander, its carrier bus sped past Venus at\\n    a distance of 24,500 kilometers (14,700 miles) and followed its twin \\n    to comet Halley, making a closer flyby on March 9, 1986 at just 8,030 \\n    kilometers (4,818 miles).  Both probes helped to reveal that the comet \\n    is a very dark and irregular-shaped mass about fourteen kilometers \\n    (8.4 miles) across, rotating once every 53 hours, give or take three \\n    hours.\\n\\n        Since both VEGA craft were still functioning after their Halley\\n    encounters, Soviet scientists considered an option to send the \\n    probes to other celestial objects.  One prime target was the near-\\n    Earth planetoid 2101 Adonis, which VEGA 2 could pass at a distance \\n    of six million kilometers (3.6 million miles).  Sadly, the Soviets \\n    had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly \\n    a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was \\n    not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach Adonis as planned.  \\n    VEGA 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987.\\n\\n        Future Plans Diverted\\n\\n        The impressive VEGA mission had given some scientists numerous \\n    ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second \\n    world from the Sun.  One example was the VESTA mission, planned for\\n    the early 1990s.\\n\\n        This Soviet-French collaboration called for the launch of multiple \\n    probes on a single PROTON rocket in either 1991 or 1992.  The craft \\n    would first swing by Venus and drop off several landers and balloon \\n    probes.  The aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet\\'s \\n    corrosive atmosphere for up to one month, a large improvement over \\n    the VEGA balloons\\' two days.  The mission would then head out to \\n    investigate several planetoids and comets, including a possible \\n    landing on Vesta (thus the mission name), the most reflective Main \\n    Belt planetoid as seen from Earth.\\n\\n        Unfortunately for Venus exploration, plans began to change in\\n    the Soviet Union.  In 1986 the Soviets decided to reroute the VESTA\\n    mission to the red planet Mars instead of Venus, keeping the comet\\n    and planetoid aspects intact.  By this time in the Soviet space \\n    program interest was focusing on Mars.  Already under construction \\n    was an entirely new probe design called PHOBOS.  Two members of this \\n    class were planned to leave Earth in 1988 and orbit Mars the next \\n    year.  PHOBOS 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on\\n    Mars\\' largest moon, Phobos. \\n\\n        All this was a prelude to even more advanced Mars expeditions,\\n    including balloon probes, rovers, soil sample return craft, and \\n    eventually human explorers in the early Twenty-First Century.\\n    The environment of Venus was just too hostile for any serious\\n    consideration of human colonization in the near future.\\n\\n        But things began to look bleak for Soviet Venus and Mars\\n    exploration.  Both PHOBOS probes failed to complete their missions,\\n    one losing contact on the way to the Red Planet in 1988 and the other\\n    going silent in Mars orbit just one week before the planned moon\\n    landing in March of 1989. \\n\\n        In 1989 a plan was devised for a Venus orbiter to drop eight to\\n    ten penetrators around the planet in 1998.  Several years later the\\n    mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put \\n    on indefinite hold.  No other official Soviet missions to Venus have\\n    since been put forth, a sad commentary after twenty-five years of\\n    continuous robotic exploration of the planet. \\n\\n        During the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change\\n    was taking over the Soviet Union.  President Mikhail Gorbachev began \\n    to \"open up\" his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with \\n    the rest of the nations, particularly those in the West.  While the \\n    culture became less oppressive than in the past, the economy was taking \\n    a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a \"free market\".\\n\\n        These effects hit everywhere, including the space program.\\n    Missions at all levels were cut back.  The Soviets began making\\n    almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space-faring\\n    nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to \\n    make money.  \\n\\n        In early 1992 it was reported that the Soviets were offering for \\n    sale several fully-equipped VENERAs they had in storage for the price \\n    of 1.6 million dollars each, an incredibly low price for any planetary \\n    probe.  No nation took them up on the bargain.  Meanwhile the United \\n    States was gearing up for new Venus missions of their own.\\n\\n        MAGELLAN and GALILEO \\n\\n        The U.S. reactivated their long-dormant planetary exploration\\n    with the launch of the Space Shuttle ATLANTIS on May 4, 1989.\\n    Aboard the Shuttle was the MAGELLAN spacecraft, a combination of\\n    spare parts from other U.S. probes designed to make the most \\n    detailed and complete radar-mapping of Venus in history.  When\\n    MAGELLAN reached the second world in August of 1990, it would be\\n    able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108\\n    meters (360 feet), surpassing the abilities of VENERA 15 and 16.\\n\\n        In the interim another American probe was launched from a Space \\n    Shuttle which would make a quick flyby of Venus on its way to orbit \\n    the giant planet Jupiter in 1995.  On October 18, 1989, the Shuttle \\n    ATLANTIS released its second unmanned planetary probe into space, \\n    named GALILEO after the famous Italian astronomer who discovered the \\n    probe\\'s primary target\\'s major moons in 1610.\\n\\n        In the absence of a powerful enough booster to send GALILEO on\\n    a direct flight to the Jovian planet, the probe was sent around\\n    Venus and Earth several times to build up enough speed to reach\\n    Jupiter.  As a result, Venus became GALILEO\\'s first planetary\\n    goal in February of 1990.  The probe radioed back images of the\\n    planet\\'s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in\\n    that violent atmosphere.\\n\\n        On the Drawing Boards\\n\\n        With the incredible success of MAGELLAN in the last few years,\\n    new plans have been laid out for further journeys to Venus.  Scien-\\n    tists in the U.S. have talked to space scientists in the former Soviet \\n    Union - now the Commonwealth of Independent States since January 1, \\n    1992 - of a cooperative effort to launch new VENERA lander missions \\n    within in the next decade.  Japan, India, and the ESA have also\\n    considered their own Venus missions in the next few decades.\\n\\n        In February of 1993 NASA came up with several new Venus projects \\n    as part of their Discovery Program for launching inexpensive probes\\n    throughout the solar system.  For Venus two missions were selected\\n    for further study:  A Venus Multiprobe Mission involving the landing\\n    of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds, air\\n    temperature, and pressure; and the Venus Composition Probe, designed\\n    to study Venus\\' atmosphere while descending through the thick air\\n    with the aid of a parachute, much as the Soviets had done since 1967.\\n    Final project decisions will be made in 1994.\\n\\n        Humans on Venus      \\n\\n        Will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of Venus?\\n    At present the lead-melting temperatures and crushing air pressure\\n    would be threatening to any Earth life not protected in something\\n    even tougher than a VENERA lander.  Plans have been looked into\\n    changing the environment of Venus itself into something more like\\n    Earth\\'s.  However, it should be noted that any such undertaking\\n    will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide \\n    atmosphere, a major reduction in surface heat, and the ability \\n    to speed up the planet\\'s rotation rate to something a bit faster\\n    than once every 243 Earth days.  Such a project may take centuries\\n    if not millennia.\\n\\n        In the meantime efforts should be made to better understand\\n    Venus as its exists today.  We still have yet to fully know how\\n    a world so seemingly similar to Earth in many important ways became\\n    instead such a deadly place.  Will Earth ever suffer this fate?\\n    Perhaps Venus holds the answers.  Such answers may best be found\\n    through international cooperation, including the nation which \\n    made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from Venus.\\n\\n        Bibliography -\\n\\n         Barsukov, V.

Ancient astronomers observed points of\\nlight that appeared to move among the stars. They called these\\nobjects planets, meaning wanderers, and named them after Roman\\ndeities -- Jupiter, king of the gods; Mars, the god of war;\\nMercury, messenger of the gods; Venus, the god of love and\\nbeauty, and Saturn, father of Jupiter and god of agriculture. The\\nstargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails, and meteors\\nor shooting stars apparently falling from the sky.\\n\\n     Science flourished during the European Renaissance.\\nFundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were\\ndiscovered, and the orbits of the planets around the Sun were\\ncalculated. In the 17th century, astronomers pointed a new device\\ncalled the telescope at the heavens and made startling\\ndiscoveries.\\n\\n     But the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of\\nsolar system exploration. Advancements in rocketry after World\\nWar II enabled our machines to break the grip of Earth\\'s gravity\\nand travel to the Moon and to other planets.\\n\\n     The United States has sent automated spacecraft, then\\nhuman-crewed expeditions, to explore the Moon. Our automated\\nmachines have orbited and landed on Venus and Mars; explored the\\nSun\\'s environment; observed comets, and made close-range surveys\\nwhile flying past Mercury, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune.\\n\\n     These travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and\\nunderstanding of the solar system. Through the electronic sight\\nand other \"senses\" of our automated spacecraft, color and\\ncomplexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared\\nto Earth-bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light.\\nAnd dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered.\\n\\n     Future historians will likely view these pioneering flights\\nthrough the solar system as some of the most remarkable\\nachievements of the 20th century.\\n     \\n\\nAUTOMATED SPACECRAFT\\n\\n     The National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\'s (NASA\\'s)\\nautomated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many\\nshapes and sizes. While they are designed to fulfill separate and\\nspecific mission objectives, the craft share much in common.\\n\\n     Each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments\\nselected for a particular mission, supported by basic subsystems\\nfor electrical power, trajectory and orientation control, as well\\nas for processing data and communicating with Earth.\\n\\n     Electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft\\ninstruments and systems. NASA uses both solar energy from arrays\\nof photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its\\nsolar system missions. Rechargeable batteries are employed for\\nbackup and supplemental power.\\n\\n     Imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed\\nmillions of miles through space to fly but one time near a\\nplanet, only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments\\npointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target! To help\\nprevent such a mishap, a subsystem of small thrusters is used to\\ncontrol spacecraft.\\n\\n     The thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a\\nconstant gaze at selected stars. Just as Earth\\'s early seafarers\\nused the stars to navigate the oceans, spacecraft use stars to\\nmaintain their bearings in space. With the subsystem locked onto\\nfixed points of reference, flight controllers can keep a\\nspacecraft\\'s scientific instruments pointed at the target body\\nand the craft\\'s communications antennas pointed toward Earth. The\\nthrusters can also be used to fine-tune the flight path and speed\\nof the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at\\nthe planned distance and on the proper trajectory.\\n\\n     Between 1959 and 1971, NASA spacecraft were dispatched to\\nstudy the Moon and the solar environment; they also scanned the\\ninner planets other than Earth -- Mercury, Venus and Mars. These\\nthree worlds, and our own, are known as the terrestrial planets\\nbecause they share a solid-rock composition.\\n\\n     For the early planetary reconnaissance missions, NASA\\nemployed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the\\nMariners. Their flights helped shape the planning of later\\nmissions. Between 1962 and 1975, seven Mariner missions conducted\\nthe first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space.\\n\\n     All of the Mariners used solar panels as their primary power\\nsource. The first and the final versions of the spacecraft had\\ntwo wings covered with photovoltaic cells. Other Mariners were\\nequipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal\\nbodies.\\n\\n     Although the Mariners ranged from the Mariner 2 Venus\\nspacecraft, weighing in at 203 kilograms (447 pounds), to the\\nMariner 9 Mars Orbiter, weighing in at 974 kilograms (2,147\\npounds), their basic design remained quite similar throughout the\\nprogram. The Mariner 5 Venus spacecraft, for example, had\\noriginally been a backup for the Mariner 4 Mars flyby. The\\nMariner 10 spacecraft sent to Venus and Mercury used components\\nleft over from the Mariner 9 Mars Orbiter program.\\n\\n     In 1972, NASA launched Pioneer 10, a Jupiter spacecraft.\\nInterest was shifting to four of the outer planets -- Jupiter,\\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune -- giant balls of dense gas quite\\ndifferent from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed.\\n\\n     Four NASA spacecraft in all -- two Pioneers and two Voyagers\\n-- were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar\\nsystem. Because of the distances involved, these travelers took\\nanywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations.\\nBarring faster spacecraft, they will eventually become the first\\nhuman artifacts to journey to distant stars. Because the Sun\\'s\\nlight becomes so faint in the outer solar system, these travelers\\ndo not use solar power but instead operate on electricity\\ngenerated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes.\\n\\n     NASA also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit\\nour neighbors Mars and Venus in the middle and late 1970s. Twin\\nViking Landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather\\nstations and as biology laboratories. Two advanced orbiters --\\ndescendants of the Mariner craft -- carried the Viking Landers\\nfrom Earth and then studied martian features from above.\\n\\n     Two drum-shaped Pioneer spacecraft visited Venus in 1978.\\nThe Pioneer Venus Orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument\\nthat allowed it to \"see\" through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover\\nto study surface features. The Pioneer Venus Multiprobe carried\\nfour probes that were dropped through the clouds. The probes and\\nthe main body -- all of which contained scientific instruments --\\nradioed information about the planet\\'s atmosphere during their\\ndescent toward the surface.\\n\\n     A new generation of automated spacecraft -- including\\nMagellan, Galileo, Ulysses, Mars Observer, the Comet\\nRendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini -- is being\\ndeveloped and sent out into the solar system to make detailed\\nexaminations that will increase our understanding of our\\nneighborhood and our own planet.\\n     \\n\\nThe Sun\\n\\n     A discussion of the objects in the solar system must start\\nwith the Sun. The Sun dwarfs the other bodies, representing\\napproximately 99.86 percent of all the mass in the solar system;\\nall of the planets, moons, asteroids, comets, dust and gas add up\\nto only about 0.14 percent. This 0.14 percent represents the\\nmaterial left over from the Sun\\'s formation. One hundred and nine\\nEarths would be required to fit across the Sun\\'s disk, and its\\ninterior could hold over 1.3 million Earths.\\n\\n     As a star, the Sun generates energy through the process of\\nfusion. The temperature at the Sun\\'s core is 15 million degrees\\nCelsius (27 million degrees Fahrenheit), and the pressure there\\nis 340 billion times Earth\\'s air pressure at sea level. The Sun\\'s\\nsurface temperature of 5,500 degrees Celsius (10,000 degrees\\nFahrenheit) seems almost chilly compared to its core-temperature.\\nAt the solar core, hydrogen can fuse into helium, producing\\nenergy. The Sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams\\nof charged particles, both extending far beyond the planets.\\n\\n     The Sun appears to have been active for 4.6 billion years\\nand has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or\\nso. At the end of its life, the Sun will start to fuse helium\\ninto heavier elements and begin to swell up, ultimately growing\\nso large that it will swallow Earth. After a billion years as a\\n\"red giant,\" it will suddenly collapse into a \"white dwarf\" --\\nthe final end product of a star like ours. It may take a trillion\\nyears to cool off completely.\\n\\n     Many spacecraft have explored the Sun\\'s environment, but\\nnone have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately\\ntwo-thirds of the distance from Earth to the Sun. Pioneers 5-11,\\nthe Pioneer Venus Orbiter, Voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft\\nhave all sampled the solar environment. The Ulysses spacecraft,\\nlaunched on October 6, 1990, is a joint solar mission of NASA and\\nthe European Space Agency. After using Jupiter\\'s gravity to\\nchange its trajectory, Ulysses will fly over the Sun\\'s polar\\nregions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of\\nstudies using nine onboard scientific instruments.\\n\\n     We are fortunate that the Sun is exactly the way it is. If\\nit were different in almost any way, life would almost certainly\\nnever have developed on Earth.\\n     \\n\\nMercury\\n\\n     Obtaining the first close-up views of Mercury was the\\nprimary objective of the Mariner 10 spacecraft, launched on\\nNovember 3, 1973, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida. After a\\njourney of nearly five months, which included a flyby of Venus,\\nthe spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers (437 miles) of the\\nsolar system\\'s innermost planet on March 29, 1974.\\n\\n     Until Mariner 10, little was known about Mercury. Even the\\nbest telescopic views from Earth showed Mercury as an indistinct\\nobject lacking any surface detail. The planet is so close to the\\nSun that it is usually lost in solar glare. When the planet is\\nvisible on Earth\\'s horizon just after sunset or before dawn, it\\nis obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere. Only radar\\ntelescopes gave any hint of Mercury\\'s surface conditions prior to\\nthe voyage of Mariner 10.\\n\\n     The photographs Mariner 10 radioed back to Earth revealed an\\nancient, heavily cratered surface, closely resembling our own\\nMoon. The pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the\\nplanet. These apparently were created when Mercury\\'s interior\\ncooled and shrank, buckling the planet\\'s crust. The cliffs are as\\nhigh as 3 kilometers (2 miles) and as long as 500 kilometers (310\\nmiles).\\n\\n     Instruments on Mariner 10 discovered that Mercury has a weak\\nmagnetic field and a trace of atmosphere -- a trillionth the\\ndensity of Earth\\'s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon, neon\\nand helium. When the planet\\'s orbit takes it closest to the Sun,\\nsurface temperatures range from 467 degrees Celsius (872 degrees\\nFahrenheit) on Mercury\\'s sunlit side to -183 degrees Celsius\\n(-298 degrees Fahrenheit) on the dark side. This range in surface\\ntemperature -- 650 degrees Celsius (1,170 degrees Fahrenheit) --\\nis the largest for a single body in the solar system. Mercury\\nliterally bakes and freezes at the same time.\\n\\n     Days and nights are long on Mercury. The combination of a\\nslow rotation relative to the stars (59 Earth days) and a rapid\\nrevolution around the Sun (88 Earth days) means that one Mercury\\nsolar day takes 176 Earth days or two Mercury years -- the time\\nit takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the\\nSun! \\n\\n     Mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like\\nthat of Earth. Scientists believe Mercury has a heavy iron-rich\\ncore making up slightly less than half of its volume. That would\\nmake Mercury\\'s core larger, proportionally, than the Moon\\'s core\\nor those of any of the planets.\\n\\n     After the initial Mercury encounter, Mariner 10 made two\\nadditional flybys -- on September 21, 1974, and March 16, 1975 --\\nbefore control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted\\nand the mission was concluded. Each flyby took place at the same\\nlocal Mercury time when the identical half of the planet was\\nilluminated; as a result, we still have not seen one-half of the\\nplanet\\'s surface.\\n     \\n\\nVenus\\n\\n     Veiled by dense cloud cover, Venus -- our nearest planetary\\nneighbor -- was the first planet to be explored. The Mariner 2\\nspacecraft, launched on August 27, 1962, was the first of more\\nthan a dozen successful American and Soviet missions to study the\\nmysterious planet. As spacecraft flew by or orbited Venus,\\nplunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on Venus\\' surface,\\nromantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to\\nrest.\\n\\n     On December 14, 1962, Mariner 2 passed within 34,839\\nkilometers (21,648 miles) of Venus and became the first\\nspacecraft to scan another planet; onboard instruments measured\\nVenus for 42 minutes. Mariner 5, launched in June 1967, flew much\\ncloser to the planet. Passing within 4,094 kilometers (2,544\\nmiles) of Venus on the second American flyby, Mariner 5\\'s\\ninstruments measured the planet\\'s magnetic field, ionosphere,\\nradiation belts and temperatures. On its way to Mercury, Mariner\\n10 flew by Venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to Earth\\nshowing cloud circulation patterns in the Venusian atmosphere.\\n\\n     In the spring and summer of 1978, two spacecraft were\\nlaunched to further unravel the mysteries of Venus. On December 4\\nof the same year, the Pioneer Venus Orbiter became the first\\nspacecraft placed in orbit around the planet.\\n\\n     Five days later, the five separate components making up the\\nsecond spacecraft -- the Pioneer Venus Multiprobe -- entered the\\nVenusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet. The\\nfour small, independent probes and the main body radioed\\natmospheric data back to Earth during their descent toward the\\nsurface. Although designed to examine the atmosphere, one of the\\nprobes survived its impact with the surface and continued to\\ntransmit data for another hour.\\n\\n     Venus resembles Earth in size, physical composition and\\ndensity more closely than any other known planet. However,\\nspacecraft have discovered significant differences as well. For\\nexample, Venus\\' rotation (west to east) is retrograde (backward)\\ncompared to the east-to-west spin of Earth and most of the other\\nplanets.\\n\\n     Approximately 96.5 percent of Venus\\' atmosphere (95 times as\\ndense as Earth\\'s) is carbon dioxide. The principal constituent of\\nEarth\\'s atmosphere is nitrogen. Venus\\' atmosphere acts like a\\ngreenhouse, permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but\\ntrapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into\\nspace. As a result, the planet\\'s average surface temperature is\\n482 degrees Celsius (900 degrees Fahrenheit), hot enough to melt\\nlead.\\n\\n     A radio altimeter on the Pioneer Venus Orbiter provided the\\nfirst means of seeing through the planet\\'s dense cloud cover and\\ndetermining surface features over almost the entire planet.\\nNASA\\'s Magellan spacecraft, launched on May 5, 1989, has been in\\norbit around Venus since August 10, 1990. The spacecraft uses\\nradar-mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh-resolution images\\nof the surface.\\n\\n     Magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic\\nfeatures, faults and impact craters. Huge areas of the surface\\nshow evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows\\nlying on top of previous ones. An elevated region named Ishtar\\nTerra is a lava-filled basin as large as the United States. At\\none end of this plateau sits Maxwell Montes, a mountain the size\\nof Mount Everest. Scarring the mountain\\'s flank is a\\n100-kilometer (62-mile) wide, 2.5-kilometer (1.5-mile) deep\\nimpact crater named Cleopatra. (Almost all features on Venus are\\nnamed for women; Maxwell Montes, Alpha Regio and Beta Regio are\\nthe exceptions.) Craters survive on Venus for perhaps 400 million\\nyears because there is no water and very little wind erosion.\\n\\n     Extensive fault-line networks cover the planet, probably the\\nresult of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics\\non Earth. But on Venus the surface temperature is sufficient to\\nweaken the rock, which cracks just about everywhere, preventing\\nthe formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like\\nthe San Andreas Fault in California.\\n\\n     Venus\\' predominant weather pattern is a high-altitude,\\nhigh-speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid. At\\nspeeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers (225 miles) per hour,\\nthe clouds circle the planet in only four Earth days. The\\ncirculation is in the same direction -- west to east -- as Venus\\'\\nslow rotation of 243 Earth days, whereas Earth\\'s winds blow in\\nboth directions -- west to east and east to west -- in six\\nalternating bands. Venus\\' atmosphere serves as a simplified\\nlaboratory for the study of our weather.\\n     \\n\\nEarth\\n\\n     As viewed from space, our world\\'s distinguishing\\ncharacteristics are its blue waters, brown and green land masses\\nand white clouds. We are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting\\nof 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other\\nconstituents. The only planet in the solar system known to harbor\\nlife, Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 150 million\\nkilometers (93 million miles). Earth is the third planet from the\\nSun and the fifth largest in the solar system, with a diameter\\njust a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus.\\n\\n     Our planet\\'s rapid spin and molten nickel-iron core give\\nrise to an extensive magnetic field, which, along with the\\natmosphere, shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation\\ncoming from the Sun and other stars. Earth\\'s atmosphere protects\\nus from meteors as well, most of which burn up before they can\\nstrike the surface. Active geological processes have left no\\nevidence of the pelting Earth almost certainly received soon\\nafter it formed -- about 4.6 billion years ago. Along with the\\nother newly formed planets, it was showered by space debris in\\nthe early days of the solar system.\\n\\n     From our journeys into space, we have learned much about our\\nhome planet. The first American satellite -- Explorer 1 -- was\\nlaunched from Cape Canaveral in Florida on January 31, 1958, and\\ndiscovered an intense radiation zone, now called the Van Allen\\nradiation belts, surrounding Earth.\\n\\n     Since then, other research satellites have revealed that our\\nplanet\\'s magnetic field is distorted into a tear-drop shape by\\nthe solar wind -- the stream of charged particles continuously\\nejected from the Sun. We\\'ve learned that the magnetic field does\\nnot fade off into space but has definite boundaries. And we now\\nknow that our wispy upper atmosphere, once believed calm and\\nuneventful, seethes with activity -- swelling by day and\\ncontracting by night. Affected by changes in solar activity, the\\nupper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on Earth.\\n\\n     Besides affecting Earth\\'s weather, solar activity gives rise\\nto a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere. When charged\\nparticles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth\\'s magnetic\\nfield, they collide with air molecules above our planet\\'s\\nmagnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and are\\nknown as the auroras or the northern and southern lights.\\n\\n     Satellites about 35,789 kilometers (22,238 miles) out in\\nspace play a major role in daily local weather forecasting. These\\nwatchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms. Continuous\\nglobal monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and\\ncontributes to a better understanding of Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems.\\n\\n     From their unique vantage points, satellites can survey\\nEarth\\'s oceans, land use and resources, and monitor the planet\\'s\\nhealth. These eyes in space have saved countless lives, provided\\ntremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our\\nplanet in dangerous ways.\\n     \\n\\nThe Moon\\n\\n     The Moon is Earth\\'s single natural satellite. The first\\nhuman footsteps on an alien world were made by American\\nastronauts on the dusty surface of our airless, lifeless\\ncompanion. In preparation for the human-crewed Apollo\\nexpeditions, NASA dispatched the automated Ranger, Surveyor and\\nLunar Orbiter spacecraft to study the Moon between 1964 and 1968.\\n\\n     NASA\\'s Apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials\\nand data. Six two-astronaut crews landed on and explored the\\nlunar surface between 1969 and 1972, carrying back a collection\\nof rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms (842 pounds)\\nand consisting of more than 2,000 separate samples.\\n\\n     From this material and other studies, scientists have\\nconstructed a history of the Moon that includes its infancy.\\nRocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4.0-4.3\\nbillion years old. The first few million years of the Moon\\'s\\nexistence were so violent that few traces of this period remain.\\nAs a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into\\ndifferent kinds of rock, the Moon was bombarded by huge asteroids\\nand smaller objects. Some of the asteroids were as large as Rhode\\nIsland or Delaware, and their collisions with the Moon created\\nbasins hundreds of kilometers across.\\n\\n     This catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four\\nbillion years ago, leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge,\\noverlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken\\nrock. Heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to\\nmelt the interior of the Moon at depths of about 200 kilometers\\n(125 miles) below the surface. Then, for the next 700 million\\nyears -- from about 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago -- lava rose\\nfrom inside the Moon. The lava gradually spread out over the\\nsurface, flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas\\nthat Galileo Galilei, an astronomer of the Italian Renaissance,\\ncalled maria, meaning seas.\\n\\n     As far as we can tell, there has been no significant\\nvolcanic activity on the Moon for more than three billion years.\\nSince then, the lunar surface has been altered only by\\nmicrometeorites, by the atomic particles from the Sun and stars,\\nby the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and\\nastronauts. If our astronauts had landed on the Moon a billion\\nyears ago, they would have seen a landscape very similar to the\\none today. Thousands of years from now, the footsteps left by the\\nApollo crews will remain sharp and clear.\\n\\n     The origin of the Moon is still a mystery. Four theories\\nattempt an explanation: the Moon formed near Earth as a separate\\nbody; it was torn from Earth; it formed somewhere else and was\\ncaptured by our planet\\'s gravity, or it was the result of a\\ncollision between Earth and an asteroid about the size of Mars.\\nThe last theory has some good support but is far from certain.\\n     \\n\\nMars\\n\\n     Of all the planets, Mars has long been considered the solar\\nsystem\\'s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life.\\nAstronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what\\nappeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface. These\\nobservations -- later determined to be optical illusions -- led\\nto the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a\\nsystem of irrigation canals on the planet. In 1938, when Orson\\nWelles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction\\nclassic War of the Worlds  by H.G. Wells, enough people believed\\nin the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic.\\n\\n     Another reason for scientists to expect life on Mars had to\\ndo with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet\\'s\\nsurface. This phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might\\nsupport a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months\\nand cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods.\\n\\n     So far, six American missions to Mars have been carried out.\\nFour Mariner spacecraft -- three flying by the planet and one\\nplaced into martian orbit -- surveyed the planet extensively\\nbefore the Viking Orbiters and Landers arrived.\\n\\n     Mariner 4, launched in late 1964, flew past Mars on July 14,\\n1965, coming within 9,846 kilometers (6,118 miles) of the\\nsurface. Transmitting to Earth 22 close-up pictures of the\\nplanet, the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring\\nchannels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water.\\nMariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of\\n1969 and returned 201 pictures. Mariners 4, 6 and 7 showed a\\ndiversity of surface conditions as well as a thin, cold, dry\\natmosphere of carbon dioxide.\\n\\n     On May 30, 1971, the Mariner 9 Orbiter was launched on a\\nmission to make a year-long study of the martian surface. The\\nspacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift-off, only to\\nfind Mars in the midst of a planet-wide dust storm that made\\nsurface photography impossible for several weeks. But after the\\nstorm cleared, Mariner 9 began returning the first of 7,329\\npictures; these revealed previously unknown martian features,\\nincluding evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across\\nthe surface, etching river valleys and flood plains.\\n\\n     In August and September 1975, the Viking 1 and 2 spacecraft\\n-- each consisting of an orbiter and a lander -- lifted off from\\nKennedy Space Center. The mission was designed to answer several\\nquestions about the red planet, including, Is there life there?\\nNobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities, but it was\\nhoped that the biology experiments on the Viking Landers would at\\nleast find evidence of primitive life -- past or present.\\n\\n     Viking Lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully\\ntouch down on another planet when it landed on July 20, 1976,\\nwhile the United States was celebrating its Bicentennial. Photos\\nsent back from the Chryse Planitia (\"Plains of Gold\") showed a\\nbleak, rusty-red landscape. Panoramic images returned by the\\nlander revealed a rolling plain, littered with rocks and marked\\nby rippled sand dunes. Fine red dust from the martian soil gives\\nthe sky a salmon hue. When Viking Lander 2 touched down on Utopia\\nPlanitia on September 3, 1976, it viewed a more rolling landscape\\nthan the one seen by its predecessor -- one without visible\\ndunes.\\n\\n     The results sent back by the laboratory on each Viking\\nLander were inconclusive. Small samples of the red martian soil\\nwere tested in three different experiments designed to detect\\nbiological processes. While some of the test results seemed to\\nindicate biological activity, later analysis confirmed that this\\nactivity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet\\'s soil\\nchemistry. Is there life on Mars? No one knows for sure, but the\\nViking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist\\nthere.\\n\\n     The Viking Landers became weather stations, recording wind\\nvelocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and\\npressure. Few weather changes were observed. The highest\\ntemperature recorded by either craft was -14 degrees Celsius (7\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) at the Viking Lander 1 site in midsummer.\\n\\n     The lowest temperature, -120 degrees Celsius (-184 degrees\\nFahrenheit), was recorded at the more northerly Viking Lander 2\\nsite during winter. Near-hurricane wind speeds were measured at\\nthe two martian weather stations during global dust storms, but\\nbecause the atmosphere is so thin, wind force is minimal. Viking\\nLander 2 photographed light patches of frost -- probably\\nwater-ice -- during its second winter on the planet.\\n\\n     The martian atmosphere, like that of Venus, is primarily\\ncarbon dioxide. Nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small\\npercentages. Martian air contains only about 1/1,000 as much\\nwater as our air, but even this small amount can condense out,\\nforming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around\\nthe slopes of towering volcanoes. Local patches of early morning\\nfog can form in valleys.\\n\\n     There is evidence that in the past a denser martian\\natmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet. Physical\\nfeatures closely resembling shorelines, gorges, riverbeds and\\nislands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet.\\n\\n     Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are small and\\nirregularly shaped and possess ancient, cratered surfaces. It is\\npossible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too\\nclose to Mars and were captured by its gravity.\\n\\n     The Viking Orbiters and Landers exceeded by large margins\\ntheir design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days, respectively. The\\nfirst to fail was Viking Orbiter 2, which stopped operating on\\nJuly 24, 1978, when a leak depleted its attitude-control gas.\\nViking Lander 2 operated until April 12, 1980, when it was shut\\ndown because of battery degeneration. Viking Orbiter 1 quit on\\nAugust 7, 1980, when the last of its attitude-control gas was\\nused up. Viking Lander 1 ceased functioning on November 13, 1983.\\n\\n     Despite the inconclusive results of the Viking biology\\nexperiments, we know more about Mars than any other planet except\\nEarth. NASA\\'s Mars Observer spacecraft, to be launched in\\nSeptember 1992, will expand our knowledge of the martian\\nenvironment and lead to human exploration of the red planet. \\n     \\n\\nAsteroids\\n\\n     The solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic\\nobjects that are in orbit around the Sun but are too small to be\\nconsidered full-fledged planets. These objects are known as\\nasteroids or minor planets. Most, but not all, are found in a\\nband or belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Some have\\norbits that cross Earth\\'s path, and there is evidence that Earth\\nhas been hit by asteroids in the past. One of the least eroded,\\nbest preserved examples is the Barringer Meteor Crater near\\nWinslow, Arizona.\\n\\n     Asteroids are material left over from the formation of the\\nsolar system. One theory suggests that they are the remains of a\\nplanet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago. More\\nlikely, asteroids are material that never coalesced into a\\nplanet. In fact, if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was\\ngathered into a single object, the object would be only about\\n1,500 kilometers (932 miles) across -- less than half the\\ndiameter of our Moon. \\n\\n     Thousands of asteroids have been identified from Earth. It\\nis estimated that 100,000 are bright enough to eventually be\\nphotographed through Earth-based telescopes.\\n\\n     Much of our understanding about asteroids comes from\\nexamining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of\\nEarth. Asteroids that are on a collision course with Earth are\\ncalled meteoroids. When a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at\\nhigh velocity, friction causes this chunk of space matter to\\nincinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor. If the\\nmeteoroid does not burn up completely, what\\'s left strikes\\nEarth\\'s surface and is called a meteorite. One of the best places\\nto look for meteorites is the ice cap of Antarctica.\\n\\n     Of all the meteorites examined, 92.8 percent are composed of\\nsilicate (stone), and 5.7 percent are composed of iron and\\nnickel; the rest are a mixture of the three materials. Stony\\nmeteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much\\nlike terrestrial rocks.\\n\\n     Since asteroids are material from the very early solar\\nsystem, scientists are interested in their composition.\\nSpacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found\\nthat the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are\\nseparated by very large distances.\\n\\n     Current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids\\nfor closer examination. The Galileo Orbiter, launched by NASA in\\nOctober 1989, will investigate main-belt asteroids on its way to\\nJupiter. The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) and Cassini\\nmissions will also study these far-flung objects. Scheduled for\\nlaunch in the latter part of the 1990s, the CRAF and Cassini\\nmissions are a collaborative project of NASA, the European Space\\nAgency and the federal space agencies of Germany and Italy, as\\nwell as the United States Air Force and the Department of Energy.\\nOne day, space factories will mine the asteroids for raw\\nmaterials.\\n     \\n\\nJupiter\\n\\n     Beyond Mars and the asteroid belt, in the outer regions of\\nour solar system, lie the giant planets of Jupiter, Saturn,\\nUranus and Neptune. In 1972, NASA dispatched the first of four\\nspacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these\\ncolossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock. Jupiter\\nwas the first port of call.\\n\\n     Pioneer 10, which lifted off from Kennedy Space Center in\\nMarch 1972, was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid\\nbelt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system. In\\nDecember 1973, it returned the first close-up images of Jupiter,\\nflying within 132,252 kilometers (82,178 miles) of the planet\\'s\\nbanded cloud tops. Pioneer 11 followed a year later. Voyagers 1\\nand 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned\\nspectacular photographs of Jupiter and its family of satellites\\nduring flybys in 1979.\\n\\n     These travelers found Jupiter to be a whirling ball of\\nliquid hydrogen and helium, topped with a colorful atmosphere\\ncomposed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium. Ammonia ice\\ncrystals form white Jovian clouds. Sulfur compounds (and perhaps\\nphosphorus) may produce the brown and orange hues that\\ncharacterize Jupiter\\'s atmosphere.\\n\\n     It is likely that methane, ammonia, water and other gases\\nreact to form organic molecules in the regions between the\\nplanet\\'s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying\\nbelow. Because of Jupiter\\'s atmospheric dynamics, however, these\\norganic compounds -- if they exist -- are probably short-lived.\\n\\n     The Great Red Spot has been observed for centuries through\\ntelescopes on Earth. This hurricane-like storm in Jupiter\\'s\\natmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet. As a\\nhigh-pressure region, the Great Red Spot spins in a direction\\nopposite to that of low-pressure storms on Jupiter; it is\\nsurrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and\\nare sometimes consumed by it. The Great Red Spot might be a\\nmillion years old.\\n\\n     Our spacecraft detected lightning in Jupiter\\'s upper\\natmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to Earth\\'s\\nnorthern lights at the Jovian polar regions. Voyager 1 returned\\nthe first images of a faint, narrow ring encircling Jupiter.\\n\\n     Largest of the solar system\\'s planets, Jupiter rotates at a\\ndizzying pace -- once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds. The\\nmassive planet takes almost 12 Earth years to complete a journey\\naround the Sun. With 16 known moons, Jupiter is something of a\\nminiature solar system.\\n\\n     A new mission to Jupiter -- the Galileo Project -- is under\\nway. After a six- year cruise that takes the Galileo Orbiter once\\npast Venus, twice past Earth and the Moon and once past two\\nasteroids, the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into\\nJupiter\\'s cloud layers and relay data back to Earth. The Galileo\\nOrbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close\\nto Jupiter\\'s large moons, exploring in detail what the two\\nPioneers and two Voyagers revealed.\\n     \\n\\nGalilean Satellites\\n\\n     In 1610, Galileo Galilei aimed his telescope at Jupiter and\\nspotted four points of light orbiting the planet. For the first\\ntime, humans had seen the moons of another world. In honor of\\ntheir discoverer, these four bodies would become known as the\\nGalilean satellites or moons. But Galileo might have happily\\ntraded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs\\nreturned by the Voyager spacecraft as they flew past these\\nplanet-sized satellites.\\n\\n     One of the most remarkable findings of the Voyager mission\\nwas the presence of active volcanoes on the Galilean moon Io.\\nVolcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world\\nother than Earth. The Voyager cameras identified at least nine\\nactive volcanoes on Io, with plumes of ejected material extending\\nas far as 280 kilometers (175 miles) above the moon\\'s surface.\\n\\n     Io\\'s pizza-colored terrain, marked by orange and yellow\\nhues, is probably the result of sulfur-rich materials brought to\\nthe surface by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity on this\\nsatellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the\\ngravitational tug-of-war between Io, Jupiter and the other three\\nGalilean moons.\\n\\n     Europa, approximately the same size as our Moon, is the\\nbrightest Galilean satellite. The moon\\'s surface displays a\\ncomplex array of streaks, indicating the crust has been\\nfractured. Caught in a gravitational tug-of-war like Io, Europa\\nhas been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt --\\napparently producing a liquid-water ocean. This ocean is covered\\nby an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the\\ncold of space. Europa\\'s core is made of rock that sank to its\\ncenter.\\n\\n     Like Europa, the other two Galilean moons -- Ganymede and\\nCallisto -- are worlds of ice and rock. Ganymede is the largest\\nsatellite in the solar system -- larger than the planets Mercury\\nand Pluto. The satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or\\nice and the rest rock. Ganymede\\'s surface has areas of different\\nbrightness, indicating that, in the past, material oozed out of\\nthe moon\\'s interior and was deposited at various locations on the\\nsurface.\\n\\n     Callisto, only slightly smaller than Ganymede, has the\\nlowest density of any Galilean satellite, suggesting that large\\namounts of water are part of its composition. Callisto is the\\nmost heavily cratered object in the solar system; no activity\\nduring its history has erased old craters except more impacts.\\n\\n     Detailed studies of all the Galilean satellites will be\\nperformed by the Galileo Orbiter.\\n     \\n\\nSaturn\\n\\n     No planet in the solar system is adorned like Saturn. Its\\nexquisite ring system is unrivaled. Like Jupiter, Saturn is\\ncomposed mostly of hydrogen. But in contrast to the vivid colors\\nand wild turbulence found in Jovian clouds, Saturn\\'s atmosphere\\nhas a more subtle, butterscotch hue, and its markings are muted\\nby high-altitude haze. Given Saturn\\'s somewhat placid-looking\\nappearance, scientists were surprised at the high-velocity\\nequatorial jet stream that blows some 1,770 kilometers (1,100\\nmiles) per hour.\\n\\n     Three American spacecraft have visited Saturn. Pioneer 11\\nsped by the planet and its moon Titan in September 1979,\\nreturning the first close-up images. Voyager 1 followed in\\nNovember 1980, sending back breathtaking photographs that\\nrevealed for the first time the complexities of Saturn\\'s ring\\nsystem and moons. Voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in\\nAugust 1981.\\n\\n     The rings are composed of countless low-density particles\\norbiting individually around Saturn\\'s equator at progressive\\ndistances from the cloud tops. Analysis of spacecraft radio waves\\npassing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely\\nin size, ranging from dust to house-sized boulders. The rings are\\nbright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock.\\n\\n     The rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body\\nventured too close to Saturn. The unlucky object would have been\\ntorn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its\\ninterior. Or the object may not have been fully formed to begin\\nwith and disintegrated under the influence of Saturn\\'s gravity. A\\nthird possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions\\nwith larger objects orbiting the planet.\\n\\n     Unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each\\nother, individual ring particles appear to be held in place by\\nthe gravitational pull of Saturn and its satellites. These\\ncomplex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets\\nthat make up the major rings.\\n\\n     Radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an AM\\ncar radio during an electrical storm were detected by the Voyager\\nspacecraft. These emissions are typical of lightning but are\\nbelieved to be coming from Saturn\\'s ring system rather than its\\natmosphere, where no lightning was observed. As they had at\\nJupiter, the Voyagers saw a version of Earth\\'s auroras near\\nSaturn\\'s poles.\\n\\n     The Voyagers discovered new moons and found several\\nsatellites that share the same orbit. We learned that some moons\\nshepherd ring particles, maintaining Saturn\\'s rings and the gaps\\nin the rings. Saturn\\'s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from\\nimages taken by Voyager 2 in 1981. \\n\\n     Voyager 1 determined that Titan has a nitrogen-based\\natmosphere with methane and argon -- one more like Earth\\'s in\\ncomposition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of Mars and\\nVenus. Titan\\'s surface temperature of -179 degrees Celsius (-290\\ndegrees Fahrenheit) implies that there might be water-ice islands\\nrising above oceans of ethane-methane liquid or sludge.\\nUnfortunately, Voyager\\'s cameras could not penetrate the moon\\'s\\ndense clouds.\\n\\n     Continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be\\nconverting Titan\\'s methane to ethane, acetylene and -- in\\ncombination with nitrogen -- hydrogen cyanide. The latter\\ncompound is a building block of amino acids. These conditions may\\nbe similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval Earth\\nbetween three and four billion years ago. However, Titan\\'s\\natmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit\\nprogress beyond this stage of organic chemistry.\\n\\n     The exploration of Saturn will continue with the Cassini\\nmission. The Cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will\\nalso deploy a probe called Huygens, which will be dropped into\\nTitan\\'s atmosphere and fall to the surface. Cassini will use the\\nprobe as well as radar to peer through Titan\\'s clouds and will\\nspend years examining the Saturnian system.\\n     \\n\\nUranus\\n\\n     In January 1986, four and a half years after visiting\\nSaturn, Voyager 2 completed the first close-up survey of the\\nUranian system. The brief flyby revealed more information about\\nUranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from\\nground observations since the planet\\'s discovery over two\\ncenturies ago by the English astronomer William Herschel.\\n\\n     Uranus, third largest of the planets, is an oddball of the\\nsolar system. Unlike the other planets (with the exception of\\nPluto), this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and\\nsouth poles alternately facing the sun during an 84-year swing\\naround the solar system. During Voyager 2\\'s flyby, the south pole\\nfaced the Sun. Uranus might have been knocked over when an\\nEarth-sized object collided with it early in the life of the\\nsolar system.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 found that Uranus\\' magnetic field does not follow\\nthe usual north-south axis found on the other planets. Instead,\\nthe field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet\\'s\\ncenter, a phenomenon that on Earth would be like having one\\nmagnetic pole in New York City and the other in the city of\\nDjakarta, on the island of Java in Indonesia.\\n\\n     Uranus\\' atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen, with some 12\\npercent helium and small amounts of ammonia, methane and water\\nvapor. The planet\\'s blue color occurs because methane in its\\natmosphere absorbs all other colors. Wind speeds range up to 580\\nkilometers (360 miles) per hour, and temperatures near the cloud\\ntops average -221 degrees Celsius (-366 degrees Fahrenheit).\\n\\n     Uranus\\' sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of\\nphotochemical \"smog\" believed to be a combination of acetylene,\\nethane and other sunlight-generated chemicals. Surrounding the\\nplanet\\'s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into\\nspace is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as \"electroglow.\"\\n\\n     Approximately 8,000 kilometers (5,000 miles) below Uranus\\'\\ncloud tops, there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and\\ndissolved ammonia some 10,000 kilometers (6,200 miles) deep.\\nBeneath this ocean is an Earth-sized core of heavier materials.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons, 16-169 kilometers (10-105\\nmiles) in diameter, orbiting Uranus. The five previously known --\\nMiranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania and Oberon -- range in size from\\n520 to 1,610 kilometers (323 to 1,000 miles) across. Representing\\na geological showcase, these five moons are half-ice, half-rock\\nspheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past\\nactivity, including faulting and ice flows.\\n\\n     The most remarkable of Uranus\\' moons is Miranda. Its surface\\nfeatures high cliffs as well as canyons, crater-pocked plains and\\nwinding valleys. The sharp variations in terrain suggest that,\\nafter the moon formed, it was smashed apart by a collision with\\nanother body -- an event not unusual in our solar system, which\\ncontains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments\\nfrom large impacts. What is extraordinary is that Miranda\\napparently reformed with some of the material that had been in\\nits interior exposed on its surface.\\n\\n     Uranus was thought to have nine dark rings; Voyager 2 imaged\\n11. In contrast to Saturn\\'s rings, which are composed of bright\\nparticles, Uranus\\' rings are primarily made up of dark,\\nboulder-sized chunks.\\n     \\n\\nNeptune\\n\\n     Voyager 2 completed its 12-year tour of the solar system\\nwith an investigation of Neptune and the planet\\'s moons. On\\nAugust 25, 1989, the spacecraft swept to within 4,850 kilometers\\n(3,010 miles) of Neptune and then flew on to the moon Triton.\\nDuring the Neptune encounter it became clear that the planet\\'s\\natmosphere was more active than Uranus\\'. \\n\\n     Voyager 2 observed the Great Dark Spot, a circular storm the\\nsize of Earth, in Neptune\\'s atmosphere. Resembling Jupiter\\'s\\nGreat Red Spot, the storm spins counterclockwise and moves\\nwestward at almost 1,200 kilometers (745 miles) per hour. Voyager\\n2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast-moving cloud dubbed\\nthe \"Scooter,\" as well as high-altitude clouds over the main\\nhydrogen and helium cloud deck. The highest wind speeds of any\\nplanet were observed, up to 2,400 kilometers (1,500 miles) per\\nhour.\\n\\n     Like the other giant planets, Neptune has a gaseous hydrogen\\nand helium upper layer over a liquid interior. The planet\\'s core\\ncontains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the\\nother gas giants. Neptune\\'s distinctive blue appearance, like\\nUranus\\' blue color, is due to atmospheric methane.\\n\\n     Neptune\\'s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet\\'s\\nspin axis and is not centered at the core. This phenomenon is\\nsimilar to Uranus\\' magnetic field and suggests that the fields of\\nthe two giants are being generated in an area above the cores,\\nwhere the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the\\nelectrical properties of a metal. Earth\\'s magnetic field, on the\\nother hand, is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only\\nslightly tilted and offset relative to its center.\\n\\n     Voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of Neptune\\'s rings.\\nObservations from Earth indicated that there were arcs of\\nmaterial in orbit around the giant planet. It was not clear how\\nNeptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from\\nspreading out into even, unclumped rings. Voyager 2 detected\\nthese arcs, but they were, in fact, part of thin, complete rings.\\nA number of small moons could explain the arcs, but such bodies\\nwere not spotted.\\n\\n     Astronomers had identified the Neptunian moons Triton in\\n1846 and Nereid in 1949. Voyager 2 found six more. One of the new\\nmoons -- Proteus -- is actually larger than Nereid, but since\\nProteus orbits close to Neptune, it was lost in the planet\\'s\\nglare for observers on Earth.\\n\\n      Triton circles Neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six\\ndays. Tidal forces on Triton are causing it to spiral slowly\\ntowards the planet. In 10 to 100 million years (a short time in\\nastronomical terms), the moon will be so close that Neptunian\\ngravity will tear it apart, forming a spectacular ring to\\naccompany the planet\\'s modest current rings.\\n\\n     Triton\\'s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of\\nIo and Miranda. The moon has more rock than its counterparts at\\nSaturn and Uranus. Triton\\'s mantle is probably composed of\\nwater-ice, but the moon\\'s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and\\nmethane. The moon shows two dramatically different types of\\nterrain: the so-called \"cantaloupe\" terrain and a receding ice\\ncap. \\n\\n     Dark streaks appear on the ice cap. These streaks are the\\nfallout from geyser-like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas\\nand dark, fine-grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers\\n(1 to 5 miles). Triton\\'s thin atmosphere, only 1/70,000th as\\nthick as Earth\\'s, has winds that carry the dark particles and\\ndeposit them as streaks on the ice cap -- the coldest surface yet\\nfound in the solar system (-235 degrees Celsius, -391 degrees\\nFahrenheit). Triton might be more like Pluto than any other\\nobject spacecraft have so far visited.\\n     \\n\\nPluto\\n\\n     Pluto is the most distant of the planets, yet the\\neccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside\\nNeptune\\'s orbit, where it has been since 1979 and where it will\\nremain until March 1999. Pluto\\'s orbit is also highly inclined --\\ntilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets.\\n\\n     Discovered in 1930, Pluto appears to be little more than a\\ncelestial snowball. The planet\\'s diameter is calculated to be\\napproximately 2,300 kilometers (1,430 miles), only two-thirds the\\nsize of our Moon. Ground-based observations indicate that Pluto\\'s\\nsurface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin\\natmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet\\nmoves away from the Sun. Observations also show that Pluto\\'s spin\\naxis is tipped by 122 degrees. \\n\\n     The planet has one known satellite, Charon, discovered in\\n1978. Charon\\'s surface composition is different from Pluto\\'s: the\\nmoon appears to be covered with water-ice rather than methane\\nice. Its orbit is gravitationally locked with Pluto, so both\\nbodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other. Pluto\\'s\\nand Charon\\'s rotational period and Charon\\'s period of revolution\\nare all 6.4 Earth days. \\n\\n     Although no spacecraft have ever visited Pluto, NASA is\\ncurrently exploring the possibility of such a mission.\\n     \\n\\nComets\\n\\n     The outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a\\nvisit to the inner planets. As asteroids are the rocky and\\nmetallic remnants of the formation of the solar system, comets\\nare the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only\\nfar from the Sun. Most comet nuclei reside in the Oort Cloud, a\\nloose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching\\nperhaps halfway to the nearest star.\\n\\n     Comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are\\ngravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close\\nto the Sun. As a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer\\nplanets, the volatile elements of which it is made gradually\\nwarm; by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner\\nplanets, these volatile elements are boiling. The nucleus itself\\nis irregular and only a few miles across, and is made principally\\nof water-ice with methane and ammonia -- materials very similar\\nto those composing the moons of the giant planets.\\n\\n     As these materials boil off of the nucleus, they form a coma\\nor cloud-like \"head\" that can measure tens of thousands of\\nkilometers across. The coma grows as the comet gets closer to the\\nSun. The stream of charged particles coming from the Sun pushes\\non this cloud, blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving\\nrise to the comet\\'s \"tails.\" Gases and ions are blown directly\\nback from the nucleus, but dust particles are pushed more slowly.\\nAs the nucleus continues in its orbit, the dust particles are\\nleft behind in a curved arc.\\n\\n     Both the gas and dust tails point away from the Sun; in\\neffect, the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the Sun.\\nThe tails can reach 150 million kilometers (93 million miles) in\\nlength, but the total amount of material contained in this\\ndramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase. Comets --\\nfrom the Latin cometa, meaning \"long-haired\" -- are essentially\\ndramatic light shows.\\n\\n     Some comets pass through the solar system only once, but\\nothers have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close\\nencounter with one of the giant outer planets. These latter\\nvisitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return\\nto the inner solar system.\\n\\n     Halley\\'s Comet is the most famous example of a relatively\\nshort period comet, returning on an average of once every 76\\nyears and orbiting from beyond Neptune to within Venus\\' orbit.\\nConfirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 B.C. This regular\\nvisitor to our solar system is named for Sir Edmond Halley,\\nbecause he plotted the comet\\'s orbit and predicted its return,\\nbased on earlier sightings and Newtonian laws of motion. His name\\nbecame part of astronomical lore when, in 1759, the comet\\nreturned on schedule. Unfortunately, Sir Edmond did not live to\\nsee it.\\n\\n     A comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes\\ncomparatively close to Earth. Unfortunately, on its most recent\\nappearance, Halley\\'s Comet passed no closer than 62.4 million\\nkilometers (38.8 million miles) from our world. The comet was\\nvisible to the naked eye, especially for viewers in the southern\\nhemisphere, but it was not spectacular. Comets have been so\\nbright, on rare occasions, that they were visible during daytime.\\nHistorically, comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens\\nand have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky.\\n\\n     The Comet Rendezvous/Asteroid Flyby (CRAF) spacecraft will\\nbecome the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and\\nremain in proximity to it as they both approach the Sun. CRAF\\nwill observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing\\nsunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and\\nform a coma and tails. Several spacecraft have flown by comets at\\nhigh speed; the first was NASA\\'s International Cometary Explorer\\nin 1985. An armada of five spacecraft (two Japanese, two Soviet\\nand the Giotto spacecraft from the European Space Agency) flew by\\nHalley\\'s Comet in 1986.\\n     \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n     Despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of\\nspace through an obscuring atmosphere, scientists of the past had\\nonly one body they could study closely -- Earth. But since 1959,\\nspaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our\\nneighbors in space. \\n\\n     We have learned more about our solar system and its members\\nthan anyone had in the previous thousands of years. Our automated\\nspacecraft have traveled to the Moon and to all the planets\\nbeyond our world except Pluto; they have observed moons as large\\nas small planets, flown by comets and sampled the solar\\nenvironment. Astronomy books now include detailed pictures of\\nbodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for\\ngenerations. We are lucky to be alive now to see these strange\\nand beautiful places and objects.\\n\\n     The knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar\\nsystem has redefined traditional Earth sciences like geology and\\nmeteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called\\ncomparative planetology. By studying the geology of planets,\\nmoons, asteroids and comets, and comparing differences and\\nsimilarities, we are learning more about the origin and history\\nof these bodies and the solar system as a whole.\\n\\n     We are also gaining insight into Earth\\'s complex weather\\nsystems. By seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by\\ninvestigating the Sun\\'s activity and its influence throughout the\\nsolar system, we can better understand climatic conditions and\\nprocesses on Earth.\\n\\n     We will continue to learn and benefit as our automated\\nspacecraft explore our neighborhood in space. One current mission\\nis mapping Venus; others are flying between worlds and will reach\\nthe Sun and Jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments. Future\\nmissions are planned for Mars, Saturn, a comet and the asteroid\\nbelt.\\n\\n     We can also look forward to the time when humans will once\\nagain set foot on an alien world. Although astronauts have not\\nbeen back to the Moon since December 1972, plans are being\\nformulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the\\nhuman exploration of Mars and even the establishment of martian\\noutposts. One day, taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a\\nlunar base or a martian colony!',\n",

It provides a\\n  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the\\n  \"program\" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.\\n  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a\\n  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the\\n  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and\\n  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any\\n  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real\\n  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual\\n  instrument.\\n\\n  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)\\n  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time\\n  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for\\n  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The\\n  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block\\n  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming\\n  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:\\n  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters\\n  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C\\n  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual\\n  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an\\n  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level\\n  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level\\n  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.\\n\\n  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has\\n  utility functions for memory management data communications and\\n  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for\\n  the development of custom code.)\\n\\nUltimage Concept VI\\n-------------------\\n  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual\\n  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end\\n  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.\\n  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory\\n  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,\\n  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,\\n  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.\\n\\n  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further\\n  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of\\n  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and\\n  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical\\n  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and\\n  characterization.\\n\\n  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel\\n  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and\\n  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can\\n  be imported.\\n\\n  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial\\n  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic\\n  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological\\n  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole\\n  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.\\n  Quantitative analysis provides for objects\\' detection, measurement, and\\n  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of\\n  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and\\n  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The\\n  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom\\n  modules.\\n\\n  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity\\n  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can\\n  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight\\n  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging\\n  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are\\n  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local\\n  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.\\n  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as\\n  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)\\n  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening\\n  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.\\n\\n  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even\\n  hole filling.\\n\\n  The program\\'s quantitative analysis measurements include: area,\\n  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.\\n\\n  GTFS, Inc. 2455 Bennett Valley Road #100C Santa Rosa, CA 95494\\n  707-579-1733\\n\\nIPLab Spectrum\\n--------------\\n  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the\\n  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by\\n  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user\\n  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far\\n  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool\\n  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a\\n  movie command for cycling through windows.\\n\\n\\nMacintosh-based tools\\n=====================\\n\\nNCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more\\n---------------------------------\\n  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the\\n  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results\\n  from numerical modelling calculations.

Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with\\n  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS\\n  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.\\n  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted\\n  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For\\n  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from\\n  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,\\n  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include\\n  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation\\n  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to\\n  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,\\n  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.\\n\\n  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard\\n  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,\\n  availlable from Storm Technologies.

Several steps are often required to\\n  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The\\n  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can\\n  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.

Image Analyst lets users configure\\n  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the\\n  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such\\n  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video\\n  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in\\n  radiographs.\\n\\n  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video\\n  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of\\n  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine\\n  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature\\n  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst\\n  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or\\n  a disk-stored image.\\n\\n  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user\\n  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.\\n  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically\\n  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.\\n  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and\\n  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and\\n  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR\\n  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.\\n\\n  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence\\n  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user\\n  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)\\n  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the\\n  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,\\n  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and\\n  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so\\n  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also\\n  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.\\n\\n  Automatix, Inc. 775 Middlesex Turnpike Billerica, MA 01821 508-667-7900\\n\\nIPLab\\n-----\\n  Signal Analytics Corp. 374 Maple Ave. E Vienna, VA  22180 703-281-3277\\n  FAX 703-281-2509\\n\\n  \"Menu-driven image processing software that supports 24-bit color or\\n  pseudocolor/grayscale image display and manipulation.\"\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II distributed by John Wiley has\\n  integrated image analysis.\\n\\nIMAGE\\n-----\\n  from Stanford : Try anonymous ftp from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n  It has pd source for image v2, and ready to run code for a mac under\\n  image v3.\\n\\n\\n\\nWindows/DOS PC-based tools\\n==========================\\n\\nCCD\\n---\\n  Richard Berry\\'s CCD imaging book for Willamon-Bell contains (optional?)\\n  disks with image manipulating software.

All functions can be easily accessed via the\\n  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image\\n  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that\\n  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of\\n  modules.\\n\\n  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and\\n  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and\\n  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and\\n  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and\\n  ratioing.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more\\n  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.\\n  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer\\'s environments. Using\\n  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific\\n  applications programs.\\n\\n  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick\\n  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,\\n  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be\\n  interactively driven through this control.\\n\\n  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of\\n  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of\\n  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential\\n  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be\\n  added to further enhance referenced imagery.\\n\\n  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels\\n  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help\\n  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The\\n  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional\\n  processing of remote sensed data.\\n\\n  For further information, please contact:\\n\\n  The Business Manager, CLOUGH Engineering Group Systems Division, 627\\n  Chapel Street, South Yarra, Australia 3141.

It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of\\n  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has\\n  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well\\n  as a huge user-contributed library.\\n\\n  Feature description\\n\\n  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide\\n  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,\\n  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images\\n  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.\\n\\n  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image\\n  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform\\n  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital\\n  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image\\n  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs\\n  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task\\n  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows\\n  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users\\n  become effective using HIPS on their first day.\\n\\n  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in\\n  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been\\n  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines\\n  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and\\n  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX\\n  ``filters\\'\\'.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual\\n  pages, and on-line documentation.\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents\\n  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing\\n  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating\\n  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation\\n  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.\\n  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and\\n  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.\\n  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and\\n  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and\\n  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a\\n  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun\\n  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X\\n  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an\\n  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS\\n  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with\\n  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-\\n  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices\\n  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an\\n  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It\\n  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS\\n  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or\\n  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of\\n  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.\\n\\n  Michael Landy SharpImage Software P.O.

MIRA gives\\n  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in\\n  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional\\n  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS\\n  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary\\n  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-\\n  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer\\n  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the\\n  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision\\n  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in\\n  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire\\n  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize\\n  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data\\n  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value\\n  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time\\n  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of\\n  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of\\n  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other \\n  palettes can be generated.\\n\\n\\nSupported functions include such niceties as the following:\\n\\no  image & image: + - / * interpolation\\no  image & constant: + - / *\\no  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,\\n   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.\\no  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or\\n   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.\\no  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,\\n   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp\\n   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.

Who \"tosses out\"\\nthe New Testament?  Undoubtedly a few *naive* atheists do this,\\nbut the phrasing of the question above seems to suggest that Cobb\\nascribes this more broadly.\\n\\nPerhaps the question that gets more to the heart of the matter is\\nwhy, except for some *naive* believers (who, unfortunately, far\\noutnumber nonbelievers, both naive and critical), are the gospels\\n*not* taken as \"gospel truth\" that faithfully records just what\\nhappened two thousand years ago?  This has an easy answer, and\\nthe answer has *nothing* to do with miracles: no text is taken\\nthis way by a critical reader.\\n\\nThere is a myth among some naive believers that one takes a text,\\nmeasures it by some set of criteria, and then either confirms the\\ntext as \"historically valid\" or \"tosses out\" the text.  I suspect\\nthis myth comes from the way history is presented in primary and\\nsecondary school, where certain texts are vested with authority,\\nand from writers such as Josh McDowell who pretend to present\\nhistorical arguments along these lines for their religious\\nprogram.  In fact, most texts used in primary and secondary\\nschool history classes ought to be tossed out, even the better\\nsuch texts should not be treated as authoritatively as descibed\\nabove, and Josh McDowell would not know a historical argument if\\nit bit him on the keister twice.\\n\\nLet me present the barest outlines of a different view of texts\\nand their use in studying history.  First, all texts are\\nhistorically valid.  ALL texts.  Or to put this another way, I\\nhave never seen a notion of \"historical validity\" that makes any\\nsense when applied to a text.  Second, no text should be read as\\ntelling the \"gospel truth\" about historical events, in the way\\nthat many students are wont to read history texts in primary and\\nsecondary school.  NO text.  (This includes your favorite\\nauthor\\'s history of whatever.)\\n\\nEvery text is a historical fact.  Every text was written by some\\nperson (or some group of people) for some purpose.  Hence, every\\ntext can serve as historical evidence.  The question is: what can\\nwe learn from a text?  Of what interesting things (if any) does\\nthe text provide evidence?\\n\\nThe diaries of the followers of the Maharishi, formerly of\\nOregon, are historical evidence.  The gospels are historical\\nevidence.  The letters of the officers who participated in the \\nvampire inquests in Eastern Europe are historical evidence.  The\\nmodern American history textbooks that whitewash \"great American\\nfigures\" are historical evidence.  These are all historical\\nevidence of various things.  They are *not* much evidence at all\\nthat the Maharishi, formerly of Oregon, could levitate; that\\nJesus was resurrected; that vampires exist; or that \"great\\nAmerican figures\" are as squeaky clean as we learned in school.\\nThey are better evidence that some people \"saw\" the Maharishi,\\nlate of Oregon, levitate; that some of the early Christians\\nthought Jesus was resurrected; that many people in Eastern Europe\\n\"saw\" vampires return from the grave; and that we still have an\\neducational system that largely prefers to spread myth rather\\nthan teach history.\\n\\nHow does one draw causal connections and infer what a piece of\\nhistorical evidence -- text or otherwise -- evinces?  This is a\\nvery complex question that has no easily summarized answer.\\nThere are many books on the subject or various parts of the\\nsubject.

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.\\n\\nAnd which order of Creation do you accept?\\tThe story of creation is one of the\\nmany places in the Bible where the Story contradicts itself.  The following is\\nan example...\\n\\nGEN 1:25  And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle \\nafter  their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth after his\\nkind: and God saw that it was good.\\nGEN 1:26  And God said, Let us make man in our image,  after  our likeness: \\nand  let  them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of\\nthe air, and over the cattle, and  over  all the  earth,  and over every\\ncreeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.\\n\\nGEN 2:18  And the LORD God said, It is  not  good  that  the  man should be\\nalone; I will make him an help meet for him.\\nGEN 2:19  And out of the ground the LORD God formed  every  beast of  the \\nfield,  and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he\\nwould call them: and whatsoever  Adam  called every living creature, that was\\nthe name thereof.\\n\\nEven your Bible cannot agree on how things were created.  Why should we\\nbelieve in it?',\n",
       "  \"\\n\\n\\nOf course not. I would think that would be great _fun_, not having ever\\nfelt the joy and peace the Christians speak of with a longing gaze.\\nThis is not what I got when I believed - I just tried to hide my fear\\nof getting punished for something I never was sure of. The Bible is\\nhopelessly confusing for someone who wants to know for sure. God did\\nnot answer. In the end, I found I had been following a mass delusion,\\na lie. I can't believe in a being who refuses to give a slightest hint\\nof her existence.\\n\\n\\nI suggest they should honestly reconsider the reasons why they believe\\nand analyse their position. In fact, it is amusing to note in this\\ncontext that many fundamentalist publications tell us exactly the\\nopposite - one should not examine one's belief critically.\\n\\nI'll tell you something I left out of my 'testimony' I posted to this\\ngroup two months ago. A day after I finally found out my faith is over,\\nI decided to try just one more time. The same cycle of emotional\\nresponses fired once again, but this time the delusion lasted only\\na couple of hours. I told my friend in a phone that it really works,\\nthank god, just to think about it again when I hung up. I had to admit\\nthat I had lied, and fallen prey to the same illusion.\\n\\n\\nI used to believe what I read in books when I was younger, or what\\nother people told me, but I grew more and more skeptical the more I\\nread. I learned what it means to use _reason_.\\n\\nAs a student of chemistry, I had to perform a qualitative analysis\\nof a mixture of two organic compounds in the lab. I _hated_ experiments\\nlike this - they are old-fashioned and increase the student's workload\\nconsiderably. Besides, I had to do it twice, since I failed in my first\\nattempt. However, I think I'll never forget the lesson: \\n\\nNo matter how strongly you believe the structure of the unknown is X,\\nit may still be Y. It is _very_ tempting to jump into conclusions, take\\na leap of faith, assure oneself, ignore the data which is inconsistent. \\nBut it can still be wrong. \\n\\nI found out that I was, after all, using exactly the same mechanism\\nto believe in god - mental self-assurance, suspension of fear, \\nfiltering of information. In other words, it was only me, no god\\nplaying any part. \\n\\n\\nOh? And I had better believe this? Dan, many UFO stories are much better\\ndocumented than the resurrection of Jesus. The resurrection is documented\\nquite haphazardly in the Bible - it seems the authors did not pay too\\nmuch attention to which wild rumour to leave out. Besides, the ends of\\nthe gospels probably contain later additions and insertions; for instance,\\nthe end of Mark (16:9-20) is missing from many early texts, says my Bible.\\n\\nJesus may have lived and died, but he was probably misunderstood.\\n\\n\\nThis is easy. I believe that the world exists independent of my mind,\\nand that logic and reason can be used to interpret and analyse what I\\nobserve. Nothing else need to be taken on faith, I will go by the\\nevidence. \\n\\nIt makes no difference whether I believe George Washington existed or not.\\nI assume that he did, considering the vast amount of evidence presented.\\n\\n\\nA liar, how do you know what my attitude was? Try reading your Bible\\nagain. \\n\\nI was willing to die for my faith. Those who do are usually remembered\\nas heroes, at least among those who believe. Dan, do you think I'm\\nlying when I say I believed firmly for 15 years? It seems it is \\nvery difficult to admit that someone who has really believed does not\\ndo so anymore. But I can't go on lying to myself.\\n\\nBlind trust is dangerous, and I was just another blind led by the blind.\\nBut if god really wants me, she'll know what to do. I'm willing. I just\\ndon't know whether she exists - looking at the available evidence,\\nit looks like she doesn't. \\n\\nPetri\",\n",

Pluto/Charon, he thinks,\\nformed when an impacting body hit proto-Pluto, knocking some material\\ninto a ring around Pluto which later accreted in Charon; similar to\\nideas about the formation of Earth\\'s moon.  There is good evidence\\nfrom spectra that the surfaces of Pluto and Charon are very different\\n(Pluto has methane frost, Charon doesn\\'t), which can be used as evidence\\nfor the impact theory.\\n\\n  He believes that there may be around 1000 Pluto-to-Chiron-sized objects\\nremaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside Neptune\\'s \\norbit, beyond 35 AU or so.  1992 QB1 and 1993 FW are the first members\\nof this population to be found, in his model.  Note that such bodies\\nwill be very dark, since if their surfaces are covered with methane \\nfrost, it will have photolyzed into very dark, long-chain hydrocarbons\\nby now.  The reason that Pluto has such a high albedo (around 0.5, I think)\\nis that its surface warms up JUST enough around perihelion to sublimate,\\nand when the atmosphere freezes out again, thirty years later, it forms\\nbright, new frost.  So any bodies much farther away than 30 AU are going\\nto be very hard to see.\\n\\n  I hope I haven\\'t made any errors in the transcription; if you see\\na howling mistake, it\\'s undoubtedly mine, not his.\\n\\n  By the way, he\\'s one of the top guns behind the Pluto Fast Flyby\\nmission (I think), and said that the current plans are to use a\\nTitan 4 to send the probe on \"just about a rectilinear trajectory\"\\nto Pluto (we were speaking loosely at the time...).  He\\'d like\\nto use a Proton, which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs\\nMUCH less.  His figures: $500 Million for 2 Titan 4 launches (there\\nwill be two separate probes, launched separately), or $120 Million\\nfor 2 Proton launches.  He told a story about how the Soviets originally\\noffered to sell Proton launches for $30 Million each, but were forced\\nto increase their prices in the US in order to be allowed in the\\nmarketplace.\\n\\n  I\\'m just telling you what he said.\\n\\n                          Michael\\n',\n",

As a Latter-day Saint, I believe that all of us (you,\\nme, etc.) lived once as spirit-children of God the Father (Hebrews 12:9)\\nin the pre-mortal existance. In order to continue our eternal progression,\\nan earthly probationary time was required.  (To live by faith, not by\\nsight, to choose good over evil, and to prepare ourselves in all things\\nto become worthy of a higher order of existance.)  We believe that all of\\nGod\\'s spirit-offspring were once assembled to discuss the specifics of\\nthis earthly sojourn.  One-third chose for Lucifer\\'s plan, most followed\\nthe Firstborn (the pre-mortal Jesus Christ).  Lucifer\\'s aspirations (\"I\\nwill exalt my throne above the stars of God . . .\" Isaiah 14:12-17, etc.)\\nresulted into the rebellion of his followers against the Firstborn and\\nthose who followed Him, resulting in the casting out of Lucifer (who\\nbecame Satan, the father of lies) and one-third of the hosts of heaven\\n(\"And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast\\nthem to the earth . . .\" Revelation 12:4) as demons (evil spirits).\\n\\nTo get back on OUR choice to be born on this earth, and to be subject to\\nGod and His plan (for good or bad, based upon our obedience and choices),\\nwe made that choice individually.  (God speaking to Job: \"Where wast thou\\nwhen I laid the foundations of the earth, . . . when the morning stars\\nsang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?\" Job 38:4-7).  We\\nlost the knowledge of our pre-mortal existance (the \"Veil of Forgetful-\\nness,\" somewhere in Psalms), in order to live by faith, not by sight.\\n\\nYou may not accept this scenario, neither do quite a few who rely on the\\nBible alone, which offers only fragmentary insights into this particular\\naspect of our existence as individuals, as sons and daughters of God.\\n\\n#Who is god to impose its rules on us ? Who can tell if god is REALLY so\\n#righteous as god likes us to believe? Are all christians a flock of sheep,\\n#unable to do otherwise that follow the rest?\\n#\\n#Hmmmmmmmmmmmm.\\n\\n(All Christians, by definition, ARE a flock of sheep, following the Shepherd\\nas they understand Him  ;-)  --But in any event, not all Christians believe\\nin the same theology, such as the one Latter-day Saints believe in.  (They\\nwill cry \"heresy\" and other accusations of \"perverting\" the doctrines of\\nthe Bible, while they themselves believe in a myriad of interpretations, as\\nfound in their catechisms and various do-it-yourself Bible-study manuals...)\\n\\nAs for me, I have a personal conviction that the pre-existance scenario as\\nexplained above, is most in harmony with Biblical doctrine, some Dead Sea\\nScroll books, the pseudographion, other (Jewish) sources, and last but not\\nleast, modern-day revelation on the subject.\\n\\n#I just want to point out that this is not sarcasm, I mean it.\\n#\\n#                        How should one deal with a man who is convinced that\\n#                        he is acting according to God\\'s will, and who there-\\n#     Jokke              fore believes that he is doing you a favour by\\n#                        stabbing you in the back?\\n#\\n#                                                        -Voltaire\\n',\n",

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\nversion of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\nI decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n(for better or for worse).\\n\\nI pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\na while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\nthe Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\na portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\nstation. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\nframes. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\nI captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\ncard in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\nimported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\nkeeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\nto 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n\"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\nframes.\\n\\nI then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\nfor the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\nResult: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\nThat\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\ntest movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\ndisk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\nwas only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n(also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\nI modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\nscaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\nsize. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\nobserved poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\naction, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\nentirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\nUnscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\nThe other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n\"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\nfrom within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\nA preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\nvery jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\nease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\nmuch overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\nswitching.\\n\\nA preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\nany evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\nstutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\nI guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\nkey frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\nimprove the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\neven more...',\n",

       "  '\\nInterstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies.  The \"large\"\\ngrains have sizes of order 0.1 micron and absorb visible light with\\nfair efficiency.  However, at temperatures below 100 K, 90% of the\\nthermal emission will be beyond 22 microns, where radiating\\nefficiency is poor.  (A small antenna cannot easily radiate at long\\nwavelengths.)  Thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate\\nthe energy they have absorbed.\\n\\nMoreover, the IRAS observations had a maximum wavelength of 100\\nmicrons.  Grains colder than 30 K will radiate primarily at longer\\nwavelengths, and IRAS would be relatively insensitive to them.  In\\nthe extreme limit, grains as cold as 5 K will be almost undetectable\\nby any conceivable observation.\\n\\nWorse still, IRAS color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a\\npopulation of \"small\" grains.  These grains have only perhaps 50\\natoms, and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to\\ntemperatures of several hundred or 1000 K.  Of course they cool\\nquickly and then stay cold for a while, but _when they are radiating_\\nthe characteristic temperature is several hundred K.  Even a small\\npopulation of these grains can dramatically raise the observed\\n\"average\" temperature.\\n\\nA model for local infrared emission consistent with COBE data has\\nthree components.  These represent scattered radiation from Zodiacal\\ndust (color temperature 5500 K), thermal emission from Zodiacal dust\\n(Tc = 280 K), and thermal emission from Galactic dust (Tc=25 K).  At\\nthe ecliptic poles, the emissivities or dilution factors are\\nrespectively 1.9E-13, 4E-8, and 2E-5.  The first two are roughly\\ndoubled in the ecliptic plane.\\n\\nTo find the thermal equilibrium temperature, we add up the dilution\\nfactor times the fourth power of temperature for all components, then\\ntake the fourth root.  In the table below, starlight comes from\\nAllen\\'s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent\\nto 460 zero mag stars with B-V color of 0.75.  No doubt careful work\\ncould do much better.  (The person who suggested starlight had a\\ndilution factor of E-4 must have been remembering wrong.  We would be\\ncooked if that were the case.

Considering \\nthe confusing spitting contest over \\'rights\\', (there are TOO \\ninalienable rights damn it!  The majority can be just as destructive \\nof liberty as a despot), I suspect that my post did not get out \\nof my site.    (I ain\\'t saying that dark skies are included in these \\nrights, although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them.) \\n\\n\\n\\nAnyway, here are my thoughts on this: \\n\\n\\nI\\'d like to add that some of the \"protests\" do not come from a strictly \\npractical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for \\nresearch activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.

Can you name\\none person, young or old, past or present, that you deem perfect? \\nGood luck.\\n\\n\\nThen you lie to yourself.  You do not know your shortcomings.  I have clearly\\nshown one of your shortcomings, if not two.  That is, ignorance of the Bible\\nand the arrogance you demonstrate butchering it without even knowing its \\ncontents.\\n\\n\\nBecause you have been too prideful to examine the record of him for yourself.\\nAnd to demonstate your lack of support for your conclusion, I bet you do not\\neven know what the word \"Christ\" means.  Or which prophet used \"Christ\" to \\ndescribe the \"Son of Man\". \\n\\n\\nYes.  I agree with that.  So we must learn first.  Read the Bible.  Come\\nup with our own interpretation.   Evaluate what is being said\\nand by whom.  Check the history books as well.  Compare someone else\\'s\\ninterpretation with your own.  Then make a judgment.  But I tell you the\\ntruth, 99% of what is being said in the Bible needs interpretation as \\nmuch as a coffee cup needs interpretation.\\n\\nAnd remember, the Bible isn\\'t a Guru\\'s Esoteric Guide to Metaphysics.  \\nIt doesn\\'t take a theologian to understand what is being said.    The \\nBible is a bunch of testimonies from people like you and I addressed \\nto people like you and I.  These guys wrote down what they saw and heard.  Is it \\ntheir open diary--and they want to tell you something.  And because they\\nwant you to know something, they make it very clear what they want you to\\nknow.   They didn\\'t encouch their ideas in esoteric rhetoric, but in simple\\nstraight-forward language.\\n\\n\\nYou have chosen the road that avoids the Bible.  You have chosen the\\nroad that avoids a confrontation with the living God because that\\nroad doesn\\'t look appealing to you.  You rather build your own road.  One\\nthat goes far away from that confrontation.   But be assured of this,\\nyou will have to confront him one day willingly or unwillingly. \\n\\n\\nI see what you mean.  I hear what your saying.  I am not degrading your\\nlife.  But I have heard the same irrational excuses for years.  There is nothing \\nnew in what you are saying.  And by your own words, you are \"spouting off\" \\ncontradictions.   If contradictions give you meaning, then your life must\\nbe sad.\\n\\n\\nBingo.  For God so loved the world, he GAVE his only begotton to son\\nso that whososever belives in him will have ever lasting life.   I look\\nwhat God *did*.  He has given his Son, even to his death, so that I can have \\nhope in his resurrection and know that life isn\\'t for nothing, but has\\nglorious purpose.\\n\\n\\nBecause you turn your eyes away from testimony and history.  You choose to\\nlie to yourself that he doesn\\'t exist, for you ignore what has been said for \\nthousands of years.  You sound exactly, almost verbatim, like the Lazarus of \\nJesus\\'s story starting in Luke 16:19.  And the conclusion of that story is a \\nbleak one.  Lazarus wound up in hell.  The story ends like this:\\n\\n      \"For if Lazarus doesn\\'t even listen to Moses and the Prophets,\\n       he won\\'t even believe if a man rose from the dead.\"\\n\\n\\nArrogance at its best.   The fact is, you are not rational.  Several specific\\ncases  have already been cited.   And again with this new statement, you show more irrationality with regards to heaven.  Jesus does tell you something of what to expect\\nin heaven.  Jesus expects you to use your brain to believe in him.  Jesus does\\nnot expect you to placate either.  Jesus wants you to willingly come to him, but not\\nas his grovelling slave, but rather as his brother who will share in his\\nglorious riches.  Why do you not pick up the Bible and read it for yourself.  \\nYou maintain you have an open mind.  See whether you are lying to yourself for\\nyourself.\\n\\n\\n\\nI do understand what you said.   But that\\'s is not what I feel went amiss here.\\n\\nYou missed the point.  Living a \"good life\" has no eternal consequences.\\nOnce they close the amusement park of life, to you that is the end.  To you, it \\nis over.  To you, therefore, your time spent in the amusement park is meaningless. \\nIt has no eternal consequences to you nor to anyone left on earth. \\n\\nBut then you contradict yourself.  From a previous post, you said doing evil things \\nis bad.  To you, it shouldn\\'t matter if you do evil things or good things.  It is\\nall meaningless in the end anyway.  So go rob a bank.  Go tell someone\\nyou dislike that he is a dirty rotten slime bag.  What\\'s restraining you?\\nLife after all, has no eternal consequences and accountability is irrelevant.\\n\\n\\nAt which time, you are truly not the master of yourself.\\n\\n\\nSo you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa\\nClaus delivers toys every xmas.  Don\\'t you see?  I have NO REASON to\\nbelieve that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I\\ncan\\'t similarly apply to Santa Claus.\\n\\nYou have EVERY reason to believe that what Jesus says and the witnesses\\nof Jesus say are true.  But you choose to be unreasonable and \"ignore\" the\\nreasons.  By definition, \"ignorance\". \\n\\nSanta Claus is said to live at the North Pole and have a squad of elves\\nand flying reindeer.   Ever see a flying reindeer?  Has anyone in human\\nhistory seen a flying reindeer?  Has anyone seen a reindeer whose nose \\nblinks red?    \\n\\nOn the other hand, are people born in Bethlehem?  Was Nebuchandezzar really\\na king?  Was Daniel really one of his court officials?  Were David and Solomon\\nreally kings of Israel and Judah?  Was their really a king called Jehoachin?\\nDid Sennecherib really attack Jerusalem 600 years before Christ?  Did\\nSennacherib really lose his battle--and badly?   Was there really a \\nCaiaphas who interrogated Jesus?   Yes, yes, yes . . . history verifies\\nit.  It is NONFICTION.\\n\\nDo you have a problem discerning truth from fiction?  Perhaps you\\ncan\\'t evaluate the context of Grimm\\'s Fairy Tales apart from\\nthat of the Scientific American.  I suppose you treat both with equal\\ntruthfulness or equal falsity.  Is this what you are telling me?  Or\\nis it that just do want to read the Scientific American and find out\\nthat it\\'s not a fairy tale?\\n\\n\\nGet real.  Have you ever been to Zaire?

       "  '\\nI get regular questions about gamma correction since I go to great pains to\\ndeal with it properly in xli (the image loader program I maintain).\\n\\nHere is an explanation I often use to answer these questions.\\n\\nThis might be suitable for inclusion in the FAQ.\\n\\n\\tGraeme Gill.\\n\\n###########################################################################\\n\"A note on gamma correction and images\"\\n\\nAuthor: Graeme W. Gill\\n        graeme@labtam.oz.au\\n\\nDate: 93/5/16\\n\\n\\n\"What is all this gamma stuff anyway ?\"\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nAlthough it would be nice to think that \"an image is an image\",\\nthere are a lot of complications. Not only are there a whole bunch of\\ndifferent image formats (gif, jpeg, tiff etc etc), there is a whole\\nlot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit\\ncomplicated. Gamma is one of those things. If you\\'ve ever downloaded\\nimages from BBS or the net, you\\'ve probably noticed (with most image\\nviewing programs) that some images look ok, some look too dark, and some\\nlook too light. \"Why is this ?\" you may ask. This, is gamma correction\\n(or the lack of it).\\n\\nWhy do we need gamma correction at all ?\\n--------------------------------------\\n\\nGamma correction is needed because of the nature of CRTs (cathode\\nray tubes - the monitors usually used for viewing images). If you\\nhave some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer\\nimage by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of\\nthe scene, then you have created a \"linear\" or un-gamma-corrected\\nimage. This is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate\\nthe image as if the values in the image file were light (ie. adding\\nand multiplying will work just like real light in the real world).\\nNow if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage\\nand feed it into a CRT, you find that the CRT _doesn\\'t_ give you\\nan amount of light proportional to the voltage. The amount of light\\ncoming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage\\nsomething like this:\\n\\nLight_out = voltage ^ crt_gamma\\n\\nSo if you just dump your nice linear image out to a CRT, the image\\nwill look much too dark. To fix this up you have to \"gamma correct\"\\nthe image first. You need to do the opposite of what the CRT\\nwill do to the image, so that things cancel out, and you get\\nwhat you want. So you have to do this to your image:\\n\\ngamma_corrected_image = image ^ (1/crt_gamma)\\n\\nFor most CRTs, the crt_gamma is somewhere between 1.0 and 3.0.\\n\\nIf that is all it is, why does it seem so complicated ?\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction.\\nAlso not all sources of images give you linear images (Video cameras\\nor video signals in general). Because of this, a lot of images\\nalready have some gamma correction done to them, and you are \\nrarely sure how much. If you try and display one of those images\\nwith a program that does gamma correction for you, the image gets\\ncorrected twice and looks way to light. If you display one of those\\nimages with a program that doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then it will\\nlook vaguely right, but not perfect, because the gamma correction is\\nnot exactly right for you particular CRT.\\n\\nWhose fault is all this ?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nIt is really three things. One is all those display programs\\nout there that don\\'t do gamma correction properly. Another is\\nthat most image formats don\\'t specify a standard gamma, or\\ndon\\'t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is.\\nThe third thing is that not many people understand what gamma\\ncorrection is all about, and create a lot of images with varying\\ngamma\\'s.\\n\\nAt least two file formats do the right thing.\\nThe Utah Graphics Toolkit .rle format has a semi-standard way of recording\\nthe gamma of an image. The JFIF file standard (that uses JPEG compression)\\nspecifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of 1.0 (ie. a\\nlinear image - but not everyone obeys the rules).\\n\\nSome image loaders (for instance xli - an X11 image utility)\\nallow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you\\nare using, but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to\\nview. Other image viewers (eg. xv another X11 image program) and\\nutilities (eg. the pbm toolkit) provide ways of changing the gamma\\nof an image, but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction\\nyourself, allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has,\\nand then the gamma correction you need to suite your CRT monitor.\\n\\n[ Note that xv 2.21 doesn\\'t provide an easy way of modifying the\\ngamma of an image. You need to adjust the R, G and B curves to the\\nappropriate gamma in the ColEdit controls. Altering the Intensity\\nin the HSV controls doesn\\'t do the right thing, as it fails to\\ntake account of the effect gamma has on H and S. This tends\\nto give a tint to the image. ]\\n\\nHow can I figure out what my viewer does, or what gamma my screen has ?\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma.jpg\\n(provided with xli distribution), which is a JFIF jpeg format file\\ncontaining two grayscale ramps. The ramps are chosen to look linear\\nto the human eye, one using continuous tones, and the other using\\ndithering.  If your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects\\nimages, then the two ramps should look symmetrical, and the point\\nat which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half\\nway from the top to the bottom. (To find this point it helps if\\nyou move away a little from the screen, and de-focus your eyes a\\nbit.)\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then left hand ramp will have\\na long dark part and a short white part, and the point of equal brightness\\nwill be above the center.\\n\\nIf your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction\\nfor a display, then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the\\ngamma, and decrease it if it is below the center. The value will usually be\\naround 2.2 \\n\\n[with xli for instance, you can adjust the display gamma with the\\n-dispgamma flag, and once you\\'ve got it right, you can set the DISPLAY_GAMMA\\nenvironment variable in your .profile]\\n\\nHow do I figure out what the gamma of an image is ?\\n-------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is the most tricky bit. As a general rule it seems that a lot of\\ntrue color (ie. 24 bit, .ppm .jpg) images have a gamma of\\n1.0 (linear), although there are many about that have some gamma\\ncorrection. It seems that the majority of pseudo color images\\n(ie. 8 bit images with color maps - .gif etc.) are gamma corrected\\nto some degree or other.\\n\\nIf your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will\\nlook good, and gamma corrected images will look too light.\\n\\nIf your viewer doesn\\'t do gamma correction, then linear images will\\nlook too dark, and gamma corrected images will ok.\\n\\nWhy Linear images are sometimes not such a good thing\\n-----------------------------------------------------\\n\\nOne of the reason that many high quality formats (such as\\nVideo) use gamma correction is that it actually makes better\\nuse of the storage medium. This is because the human\\neye has a logarithmic response to light, and gamma correction\\nhas a similar compression characteristic. This means images \\ncould make better use of 8 bits per color (for instance),\\nif they used gamma correction. The implication though, is that\\nevery time you want to do any image processing you should\\nconvert the 8 bit image to 12 or so linear bits to retain\\nthe same accuracy. Since little popular software does this, and\\nnone of the popular image formats can agree on a standard\\ngamma correction factor, it is difficult to justify gamma corrected\\nimages at the popular level.\\n\\nIf some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma,\\nand if image manipulation software takes care to use\\nextra precision when dealing with linearized internal data,\\nthen gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing.\\n\\n(I am told that the Kodak PhotoCD format for instance, has a\\nstandard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the\\nhighest quality out of the bits used to hold the image).',\n",

The movie I had been using only had 18 frames in it (it was a\\n   version of the very first movie I created with the Compact Video compressor).\\n   I decided something a little longer would give closer to real-world results\\n   (for better or for worse).\\n\\n   I pulled out a copy of \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" that I had recorded off TV\\n   a while back. About fifteen minutes into the movie, there\\'s a sequence where\\n   the Earth shuttle is approaching the space station. Specifically, I digitized\\n   a portion of about 30 seconds\\' duration, zooming in on the rotating space\\n   station. I figured this would give a reasonable amount of movement between\\n   frames. To increase the differences between frames, I digitized it at only\\n   5 frames per second, to give a total of 171 frames.\\n\\n   I captured the raw footage at a resolution of 384*288 pixels with the Spigot\\n   card in my Centris 650 (quarter-size resolution from a PAL source). I then\\n   imported it into Premiere and put it through the Compact Video compressor,\\n   keeping the 5 fps frame rate. I created two versions of the movie: one scaled\\n   to 320*240 resolution, the other at 160*120 resolution. I used the default\\n   \"2.00\" quality setting in Premiere 2.0.1, and specified a key frame every ten\\n   frames.\\n\\n   I then ran the 320*240 movie through the same \"Raw Speed Test\" program I used\\n   for the results I\\'d been reporting earlier.\\n\\n   Result: a playback rate of over 45 frames per second.\\n\\n   That\\'s right, I was getting a much higher result than with that first short\\n   test movie. Just for fun, I copied the 320*240 movie to my external hard\\n   disk (a Quantum LP105S), and ran it from there. This time the playback rate\\n   was only about 35 frames per second. Obviously the 230MB internal hard disk\\n   (also a Quantum) is a significant contributor to the speed of playback.\\n\\n   I modified my speed test program to allow the specification of optional\\n   scaling factors, and tried playing back the 160*120 movie scaled to 320*240\\n   size. This time the playback speed was over 60 fps. Clearly, the poster who\\n   observed poor performance on scaled playback was seeing QuickTime 1.0 in\\n   action, not 1.5. I\\'d try my tests with QuickTime 1.0, but I don\\'t think it\\'s\\n   entirely compatible with my Centris and System 7.1...\\n\\n   Unscaled, the playback rate for the 160*120 movie was over 100 fps.\\n\\n   The other thing I tried was saving versions of the 320*240 movie with\\n   \"preferred\" playback rates greater than 1.0, and seeing how well they played\\n   from within MoviePlayer (ie with QuickTime\\'s normal synchronized playback).\\n   A preferred rate of 9.0 (=> 45 fps) didn\\'t work too well: the playback was\\n   very jerky. Compare this with the raw speed test, which achieved 45 fps with\\n   ease. I can\\'t believe that QuickTime\\'s synchronization code would add this\\n   much overhead: I think the slowdown was coming from the Mac system\\'s task\\n   switching.\\n\\n   A preferred rate of 7.0 (=> 35 fps) seemed to work fine: I couldn\\'t see\\n   any evidence of stutter. At 8.0 (=> 40 fps) I *think* I could see slight\\n   stutter, but with four key frames every second, it was hard to tell.\\n\\n   I guess I could try recreating the movies with a longer interval between the\\n   key frames, to make the stutter more noticeable. Of course, this will also\\n   improve the compression slightly, which should speed up the playback performance\\n   even more...\\n\\n   Lawrence D\\'Oliveiro                       fone: +64-7-856-2889\\n   Computer Services Dept                     fax: +64-7-838-4066\\n   University of Waikato            electric mail: ldo@waikato.ac.nz\\n   Hamilton, New Zealand    37^ 47\\' 26\" S, 175^ 19\\' 7\" E, GMT+12:00\\n\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I missed the start of this thread, but there are three factors that\\ncan significantly affect QuickTime\\'s playback speed that you may want to take\\ninto account:\\n\\n(1) playback bit depth (things are fastest when you play a\\nmovie back at the bit depth it was compressed for, this is usually 8 or 16\\nbit, but other depths are (of course) possible).\\n\\n(2) type of scaling (QT is optimized for \"double size\" scaling, other scaling\\nfactors hit peformance much harder).\\n\\n(3) playback window position (MoviePlayer limits your window placement choices\\nto advantagous pixel boundaries by default, I\\'m not sure about Premiere).\\n\\nAny combination of those can radically alter playback performance.

It reduces to\\n#\\n#  (1): Alterian dosh arriving in my account is due to [benefactor or bug].\\n#\\n#  (2): this is not evidence for [benefactor], neither is it evidence for\\n#       [bug] (meaning that it doesn\\'t lend more weight to one than to the\\n#       other)\\n#\\n#  (3): therefore no evidence can exist for [benefactor] and no evidence\\n#       can exist for [bug].\\n#\\n#But (3) relies on a shift in meaning from (2). When you say (paraphrased)\\n#in (2) that this is not \"evidence for [benefactor]\", for example, what you\\n#mean is that it\\'s no *more* evidence for [benefactor] than it is for [bug].\\n\\nYes, that\\'s what I mean.\\n\\n#In (3), however, you\\'ve shifted the meaning of \"evidence for [benefactor]\"\\n#so that it now means `absolute\\' \"evidence for [benefactor]\" rather than\\n#`relative\\' \"evidence for [benefactor]\" w.r.t. [bug].\\n\\nNot really, I meant evidence that would tend to one over the other.  I\\nthink this is just a communications problem.   What I am trying to say,\\nin my clumsy way, is that while I buy your theory as far as it relates\\nto theism making predictions (prayer, your \\'Rapture\\' example), I don\\'t\\nbuy your use of Occam\\'s razor in all cases where A=0.\\n\\nIn my example, one couldn\\'t dismiss\\n[benefactor] or [bug] on the grounds of simplicity - one of these is necessary\\nto explain the dosh.  I brought up the \\'one-by-one dismissal\\' process to\\nshow that it would be wrong to do so.  From what you\\'re saying in this\\npost, it seems you agree, and we\\'re talking at cross-purposes.\\n\\n#(3) is still in contradiction to (1).\\n#\\n#Some sums may help. With B = benefactor, b = bug, d = dosh arrives in account:\\n#\\n#  (1) implies  P(B+b | d) = 1\\n#\\n#Assuming that P(Bb | d) = 0, so it\\'s either the benefactor *or* a bug\\n#which is responsible if the bucks arrive, but not both, then\\n#\\n#   P(B+b | d)   =   P(B | d) + P(b | d)\\n#\\n#so\\n#\\n#   P(B | d) + P(b | d)  =  1\\n#\\n#but (3) implies that\\n#\\n#   P(B | d)  =  0  and  P(b | d)  =  0.\\n\\nNo, this isn\\'t what I meant.  P(B | d) = 0.5 and P(b | d) = 0.5, with\\nnecessarily no new observation (we\\'ve already seen the dosh) to change\\nthose estimates.  I was trying to say (again, in my clumsy way) that\\nit would be _wrong_ to assign 0 probability to either of these.  And that\\'s\\nprecisely what use of the Razor does in the case of gods - gods are\\none class of hypothesis (there are many others) belonging to a set of\\nhypotheses _one_of_which_ is necessary to explain something which otherwise \\nwould _not_ be satisfactorily explained.  It can be thrown out or\\nretained on grounds of non-rational preference, not of science or statistics.   \\nAlternatively, one could chuck out or retain the lot, on the grounds\\nthat the answer can\\'t be known, or that the notional probability estimates\\nare effectively useless, being equal (agnosticism/weak atheism).\\n\\n#> As they do when the set M is filled by \"the universe is caused by x\",\\n#> where x is gods, pink unicorns, nothing, etc.  - and no observation\\n#> tends to one conclusion over the other.\\n#\\n#Exactly the point I was making, I think. So we don\\'t \"throw out\" any of\\n#these, contrary to your assertion above that we do.\\n\\nSome people do, Simon, and they think they are doing excellent science.\\nMy sole point was that they aren\\'t.\\n\\n#>> Only observations which directly contradict the hypothesis H[i] (i.e. x\\n#>> where P(x | H[i]) = 0) can cause P(H[i]) to go to zero after a finite\\n#>> number of observations. Only in this case do we get to throw any of the\\n#>> hypotheses out.\\n#\\n#> Exactly my point, though I may have been unclear.\\n#\\n#You said the diametric opposite, which I guess is the source of my confusion.\\n\\nI was merely trying to illustrate the incorrectness of doing so.\\n\\n#> What I\\'m trying to say is that while you are correct to say that absence of\\n#> evidence can sometimes be evidence of absence, this does not hold true for\\n#> all, or perhaps any, versions of theism - and it isn\\'t true that those for\\n#> which it does not hold can be discarded using the razor.\\n#\\n#On the contrary, those for which it does not hold are *exactly* those which\\n#can be discarded using the Razor. See my post on the other branch of this\\n#thread.\\n\\nThen you seem to be guilty of the contradiction you accuse me of.  If\\nthe razor holds for gods, then it holds for all like hypotheses.  Which\\nmeans that you\\'re assigning P(x | H[i]) =0 for all i, though we\\'ve already\\nestablished that it\\'s not correct to do so when SUM(P(x|H[i]))=1 over\\nall i.\\n\\n#> Simply put, anyone who claims to have a viable proof of the existence or\\n#> non-existence of gods, whether inductive or no, is at best mistaken, and\\n#> at worst barking mad.\\n#\\n#Luckily I make no such claim, and have specifically said as much on numerous\\n#occasions. You wouldn\\'t be constructing a strawman here, would you Frank?\\n#Although that doesn\\'t, of course, rule out my being barking mad in any case\\n#(I could be barking mad in my spare time, with apologies to Cleese et al).\\n#\\n#But I think you miss the point once again. When I say that something is\\n#\"evidence against\" an hypothesis, that doesn\\'t imply that observation of\\n#the said something necessarily *falsifies* the hypothesis, reducing the\\n#estimate of P(H | data) to zero. If it *reduces* this quantity, it\\'s still\\n#evidence against H.\\n\\nNo, I got that.  I\\'m talking about the case when A=0.  You\\'re clearly\\ncorrect when A!=0.   And I\\'m not constructing a strawman (though it\\'s\\ncertainly possible that I\\'ve misunderstood what you\\'re saying).  However,\\nby any standards, a system that says when A=0, gods are highly unlikely,\\nand when A!=0 gods can be dismissed using the Razor, is a system purporting\\nto be an inductive proof that gods either don\\'t exist, or are unnecessary\\nto explain any or all phenomena.  In my experience, systems such as this\\n(including those which purport to prove that gods exist) always contain\\na fallacy upon close examination.

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing\\n    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed\\n    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).

It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.

The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.

These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.

Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be\\nfound on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by\\nregistering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,\\nThe Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).\\n\\nThere\\'s also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write\\nfunctionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image\\nformat conversion and processing options.

You\\'ll also need a viewer program.\\nIf your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a\\ndisplay with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa\\nor PPM 24-bit image files.\\n\\nThere are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every\\nday.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find\\nthe available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,\\npurchase a hardware-assisted product.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n",

       "  'The following is what they feed to us..... most has been posted already,\\nbut there are a number of items not seen here yet.....\\n\\nRedesign Activities Update -- Following is the weekly status on redesign,\\nbased on information provided by NASA headquarters.\\n\\nThe station Redesign Team (SRT) provided a detailed status report to the\\nAdvisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 22.  The\\nday-long meeting was held in ANSER facilities in Crystal City, VA; topics\\ncovered by the SRT included a preliminary mission and goals statement for\\nthe space station; science, technology and engineering research; the\\nassessment process; and the design approach. Discussions on management\\noptions and operations concepts also were held.\\n\\nThe Design Teams then presented the three options under study:\\n\\n¥ Option A - Modular Buildup -- Pete Priest presented the A option. Priest\\nsaid the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has\\nidentified three distinct phases of evolution - power station, human tended\\nand permanent presence. The team will define the minimum capability needed\\nto achieve each phase, the total cost of each phase and the achievable\\ncapability for budget levels. The A option uses current or simplified\\nFreedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing\\nsystems such as the so-called \"Bus-1 spacecraft,\" the orbiter and Spacelab.\\n\\nThe Power Station Capability could be achieved in 3 flights with Freedom\\nphoto voltaic modules providing 20 kW of power. 30-day Shuttle/Spacelab\\nmissions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase.\\n\\nHuman Tended Capability would be provided by the addition of the U.S.\\nCommon Module Module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking\\nports for ESA and Japanese laboratories. 60-day missions with the orbiter\\ndocked to the station are assumed for this phase. Different\\noperation/utilization modes are being studied for this phase.\\n\\n¥ Option B - Freedom Derived -- Mike Griffin presented the status of Option\\nB activities. Griffin detailed the evolution of the Freedom-derived option,\\nfrom initial Research Capability, to Human-Tended Capability, to Permanent\\nHuman Presence Capability, to Two Fault Tolerance, and finally Permanent\\nHuman Capability. Griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the\\nbaseline program, with minor changes to the Communications and Tracking\\nsystem, Crew Health Care System and ECLSS, and a major change to the Data\\nManagement System.\\n\\nInitial Research Capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28.5 degree\\ninclination (3 flights to 51.6 degrees) and consist of an extended duration\\norbiter-Spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic\\narrays providing 18.75 kW of power.\\n\\nHuman-Tended Capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss\\nsegments and the U.S. lab.\\n\\nPermanent Human Presence Capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two\\norbiters providing habitation and assured crew return.\\n\\nTwo Fault Tolerance, achieved in 11 flights, would build out the other\\nsection of truss with another set of PV modules, thermal control and\\npropulsion systems.\\n\\nThe freedom derived configuration could achieve an International Complete\\nstate with 16 flights.  Three more flights, to bring up the habitat module,\\na third PV array and two Assured Crew Return Vehicles (ACRV) would complete\\nthe Permanent Human Capability with International stage.\\n\\nGriffin told the Redesign Advisory Committee that eliminating hardware\\nwould not, by itself, meet budget guidelines for the Freedom derived\\noption.  Major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including\\nprogram management, contractor non-hardware, early utilization and\\noperations costs, he said.\\n\\n¥ Option C - Singe Launch Core Station -- Chet Vaughn presented Option C,\\nthe Single Launch Core Station concept.  A Shuttle external tank and solid\\nrocket boosters would be used  to launch the station into orbit.  Shuttle\\nmain engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch\\nand jettisoned after ET separation.\\n\\nThe module, 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long, would provide 26,000\\ncubic feet of pressured volume, separated into 7 \"decks\" connected by a\\ncentralized passageway.  Seven berthing ports would be located at various\\nplaces on the circumference of the module to place the international\\nmodules, and other elements.  This \"can\" would have two fixed photo voltaic\\narrays producing approximately 40 kW of power flying in a solar interial\\nattitude.\\n\\nIn his closing comments to the Redesign Advisory Committee, Bryan O\\'Connor\\nsaid a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on April 26 so\\nthat detailed costing of the options can begin.  The next meeting with the\\nRedesign Advisory Committee will be May 3.\\n\\nRussian Consultants Arrive in U.S. -- A delegation of 16 Russian space\\nexperts arrived in the U.S. on April 21 and briefings to the SRT by members\\nof the Russian team began on the 22nd.  The group includes Russian Space\\nAgency General Director Y. M. Koptev, and V. A. Yatsenko, also of the RSA. \\nOthers on the team include representatives from the Ministry of Defense,\\nthe Design Bureau SALYUT, the Institute of Biomedical Problems, the\\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs, NPO Energia and TsNIJMASH.  The Russian team\\nbriefed the SRT on environmental control and life support system, docking\\nsystems, the Proton launch vehicle, Mir operations and utilization, and the\\nSoyuz TM spacecraft.\\n\\nThe Russian consultants are available to the SRT to assess the capabilities\\nof the Mir space station, and the possible use of Mir and other Russian\\ncapabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign.  They will\\nbe available to the SRT through May 5.\\n\\nManagement and Operations Review Continues --  Work continued in the SRT\\nsubgroups.  The Management Group under Dr. Walt Brooks is working to\\ndevelop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a\\nfoundation for the transition to development and operations.  Various\\nmanagement options have been developed including:\\n\\n¥ Lead Center with the Center Director in the programmatic chain of\\ncommand.\\n\\n¥ Host Center with the Program Manager reporting directly to an Associate\\nAdministrator.\\n\\n¥ Skunk Works/Dedicated Program Office with a small dedicated co-located\\nhand-picked program office.\\n\\n¥ Combine Space Station with Shuttle, with the space station becoming an\\nelement of the current program.\\n\\n¥ Major Tune Up to Current Organization, with current contracts and\\ngeographical distribution maintained but streamlined.\\n\\nThe Operations Group under Dr. John Cox is building on the work of the\\nOperations Phase Assessment Team lead by Gene Kranz of NASA-JSC, which had\\nalready begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its\\npreliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible.\\n\\nAs part of its work,  the Operations Group has identified teams of agency\\nexperts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of\\nassembly and operations, utilization, maintenance and logistics and testing\\nand ground operations.\\n\\nWhat\\'s in the Week Ahead? -- The Design Support Teams will provide a\\ncomprehensive status of their option to the Station Redesign Team on Monday\\nand Tuesday at which point the design will be \"frozen\" to begin the\\ndetailed cost assessment.   Also this week, the team will begin preparing\\nfor the next round of discussions with the redesign Advisory Committee, to\\nbe held May 3.\\n\\nDr. Shea Steps Down --  Dr. Joe Shea stepped down as director of the\\nStation Redesign Team on April 22 and Bryan O\\'Connor will take over the\\nactivities of the team.  Dr. Shea submitted his resignation as assistant\\ndeputy administrator for space station analysis, but will continue to serve\\nas a special advisory to NASA Administrator Goldin and be available to\\nconsult with the SRT.

       "  \"Intro to ACCESS.bus (RE: the ACCESS.bus Software Creator's \\n\\tContest Announcement)\\n\\nWHAT IS ACCESS.bus?\\n\\nACCESS.bus is a new open industry standard for computer \\nperipheral connectivity.  ACCESS.bus is a serial protocol that \\nuses simple, low-cost I2C technology to link multiple devices to \\na single PC port.  Peripheral devices such as keyboards or \\nkeypads, locators (Mice, Trackballs, Joysticks), printers, VR \\ngloves, digitizers, sensors, actuators or data transmitters and \\nothers can be easily daisy chained to the host PC.  Applications \\nsuch as CAD/CAM, Data Acquisition, Simulation, Virtual Reality, \\nMultiple-Player/Single PC Games, Education and many, many more \\ncan now take advantage of ACCESS.bus, the technology that puts \\nPlug and Play on every PC.\\n\\nThe ACCESS.bus offers advantages to end-users and developers of \\nsystems and peripherals.  Multiple devices connect to the host \\ncomputer with only one port.  Common communication methods for a \\nnumber of device types lead to simplified hardware and software \\ndevelopment.  As an open standard, ACCESS.bus enables cross-\\nplatform use of the same device.\\n\\nACCESS.bus TECHNOLOGICAL DESCRIPTION:\\n=====================================\\n\\nACCESS.bus technology is an open specification, enabling anyone \\nto implement it on host systems or in peripheral devices without \\nfee or royalty.\\nACCESS.bus has a bus topology architecture.  That is, a single \\nhost can accommodate up to 125 peripheral devices.  ACCESS.bus \\ndata rate is 100 Kbits/sec.\\n\\nACCESS.bus Physical Layer\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nACCESS.bus is a serial bus architecture, based on I2C hardware \\nprotocol, with one data line and one clock line.\\nStandard low-cost I2C microcontrollers handle bit-level \\nhandshaking, including automatic arbitration and clock \\nsynchronization.  \\n\\nACCESS.bus Software Protocols\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe ACCESS.bus communication protocol is composed of three \\nlevels: I2C Protocol, Base Protocol, and Application Protocol.\\n\\nI2C PROTOCOL: This simple and efficient protocol defines \\narbitration among contending masters without losing data.  I2C \\nprovides for cooperative synchronization of bus partners with \\ndifferent clock rates.  Bus transactions include addressing, \\nframing of bits into bytes, and byte acknowledgment by the \\nreceiver.  \\n\\nBASE PROTOCOL: Establishes the asymmetrical interconnect between \\na host computer and multiple peripherals.  The host becomes the \\nACCESS.bus manager.  The Base Protocol defines the format of an \\nACCESS.bus message envelope, which is an I2C bus transaction with \\nadditional semantics, including checksum.\\nUnique features of the Base Protocol are auto-addressing and hot \\nplugging.  Auto-addressing assigns devices with unique bus \\naddresses, without the need for setting jumpers or switches.  Hot \\nplugging is the ability to attach and detach devices while the \\nsystem is running, without rebooting.\\n\\nAPPLICATION PROTOCOL: This is the highest level of the ACCESS.bus \\nprotocol which defines message semantics specific to particular \\ntypes of devices.  Each type requires a different Application \\nProtocol.  Three broad device types have been identified: \\nkeyboards, locators, and text devices.\\n\\nACCESS.bus support on the PC\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nAll three levels of the ACCESS.bus protocol are supported on the \\nPC.  An add-on card implements the physical layer and uses the \\nbase protocol to communicate with physical ACCESS.bus devices.  \\nAn ACCESS.bus Manager - TSR under DOS and a DLL under Windows 3.1 \\n- controls the operation of the physical layer and interacts with \\nthe ACCESS.bus device drivers.  Drivers are available for \\nmultiple ACCESS.bus keyboards, locators and printers for DOS and \\nWindows 3.1.  Also available are C language source code examples \\nof the interface from applications to the device drivers.\\n\\n\\nTo Contact ABIG (the ACCESS.bus Industry Group):\",\n",

The\\nphrase \"deliberately mistaken\" is rather oxymoronic.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe two forms of theism most often discussed here these days are\\nChristianity and Islam.  Both of these claim to make their followers\\ninto good people, and claim that much of benefit to humanity has been\\naccomplished through their faiths.  IMHO they are right.  The American\\nFriends Service Committee (Quaker), Catholic Relief Services, Bread\\nFor The World, Salvation Army soup kitchens, and Mother Theresa spring\\nto mind.  (Can someone with more knowledge of Islam supply the names\\nof some analagous Islamic groups?)  \\n\\nWhen Mother Theresa claims that her work is an outgrowth of her\\nChristianity, I believe her.  Her form of theism ascribes to her deity\\nsuch a benevolence toward humanity that it would be wrong not to care\\nfor those in need.  The point is that such a philosophy does have the\\npower to change the behavior of individuals;  if it is widespread\\nenough, it can change societies.\\n\\nThe same works for the horrors of history.  To claim that Christianity\\nhad little to do with the Crusades or the Inquisition is to deny the\\nawesome power that comes from faith in an absolute.  What it seems you\\nare doing twisting the reasonable statement that religion was never\\nthe solitary cause of any evil into the unreasonable statement that\\nreligion has had no evil impacts on history.  That is absurd.',\n",
       "  'Why should anyone (check: let\\'s restrict this to Christians, why do *we*)\\nwant to find \"commandments\" in the books regarded as scripture?  What\\'s\\ngoing on? I will pass on psychologizing answers (whether dismissive or more\\nopen) as not the kind of issue to deal with here -- the question is what is\\nthe *theological* point involved?  And it has been quoted \"at\" me often\\nenough by those who don\\'t believe I take it seriously, that Jesus (is said\\nto have) said, \"If you love me, you will obey my commands.\"  [John 14:15]\\n\\nI am, like any Christian, the slave of Christ, and it is my will that I\\nshould do as He wills me to do.  I am (also, or instead) His younger brother,\\nbut still under His direction, though we both call God \"Abba.\"  Christians,\\ntherefore, will try to find what it is that their Lord commands them, and\\ndiscovering it will feel obligated to do it, or to confess their failure.\\nReaders here may set aside the theologizing jargon (such as \"slaves of\\nChrist\") -- the point is that adherents of a religion *will* read the texts\\n(whether classified as \"inspired\" or not) that are held up as models, in an\\neffort to find application to their own situations.  This practice ranges\\nfrom \"devotional\" reading of sermons and the like to the exegesis of canon-\\nical scripture as \"the Word of God.\"  And at the highest pitch, this leads\\nto a question of whether we *can* find in inspired scripture something that\\ncan act as \"absolute\" guidance for our actions.\\n\\nThe problem is in finding out just *what* it is our Lord commands.  I am\\ngoing to set aside for this essay one major direction in which Christians\\nhave looked for these commands, namely Christian tradition.  That is not\\nbecause *I* reject tradition, but because my primary audience in this essay\\nis Protestants, who deny tradition a determinative value, in favor of the\\nwitness of Scripture.  The question I want to deal with is, WHAT commandments\\ncan we find from our Lord in Scripture?  And that turns out to be a hard\\nquestion.  [ If any of my Protestant Inquisitors would *like* to turn the\\ndiscussion to the authority of tradition, I can accomodate them :-), unlike\\n*most* Protestants, Episcopalians admit claims from a) Scripture b) Reason\\nand c) Tradition on roughly equal standing. ]\\n\\nEarlier in John than my quote above, we read [John 13:34] \"I give you a new \\ncommandment: love one another.\"  This is the ONLY place in the NT where\\nChristians are given an explicit commandment, with the context commenting\\non its imperative mode pronouncement by Jesus.  At the same meal [so we\\n*readers* infer, since it is *not* in John, but in the Synoptics] Jesus\\nsays, \"Take this [bread]; this is my body.\"  [Mark 14:22, cf. Matthew 26:26,\\nLuke 22:19, 1 Corinthians 11:24]  The mode is imperative (Greek _labete_),\\nand hence this, too, is a \"commandment.\"\\n\\nIn *both* cases we have to *infer* that the command is directed to a wider\\ncircle than the immediate collocation of disciples -- because we judge the\\nevangelist\\'s point in mentioning it (with the disciples by then mostly or\\nentirely dead) is that *we* are expected to follow this as a commandment\\nfrom our Lord.  In the case of communion, Paul\\'s mention (at least; this\\nis probably true of the evangelists also) implies an ongoing ritual liturgy\\nin which these words operate to \"bind\" Christians to the original command\\nto his disciples, as a continuing commandment to the Christian community.\\n\\nI am entirely comfortable with this inference, but I *must* point out that\\nit is THERE, between us and the occasion on which Jesus spoke the command.\\nI take it as a clear inference, at the very least the EVANGELIST\\'S notion,\\nthat *all* Christians are called to love one another, in Jesus\\' command\\ndirected at the disciples.  But I have to call attention to the inference.\\nThe command CANNOT apply to me without the generalization from the specific\\ncontext of its statement to my own context as a \"disciple\" of Christ.\\n\\nAll reading of scripture has to make such inferences, to get any sense out\\nof the text whatsoever.  This is a general problem in reading these texts\\n-- we cannot read them at all without our *own* understanding of our native\\nlanguages in which we (normally) read the (translated) texts, and without\\n*some* appreciation of the original context (and at points, the original\\nlanguages, when English misleads us.) I am going to presume, in what follows,\\nthat we have the *general* problem of how to read scripture under control\\n[ I don\\'t *really* think this is true, but it will suffice for my current\\npurposes. ]  I will address ONLY the issues that arise when we have already\\ncoped with the understanding of a 2000 year old text from another world\\nthan the one we live in.  Questions at THAT level only introduce MORE reser-\\nvations about the commandments issue than will be found stipulating that we\\ncan read the texts as the original audience might have done.\\n\\nAmong the reasons we have for seeing John\\'s _agapate allelou_ as a *general*\\ncommandment (not merely an instruction by Jesus to this disciples on that\\none occasion), and one linking it to the Synoptic \"Great Commandment\" is\\nthat we have criticism, from Jesus, about limiting our love to those whom\\nwe congenially associate with.  In Matthew 5:43ff we read, \"You have learnt\\nsay to you: love your enemies.\"  In fact, the Leviticus context quoted\\ndoes NOT say \\'hate your enemy\\' -- it is merely the common human presumption.\\n(And Leviticus is at pains to say that the \"love\" should extend to strangers\\namongst the people of Israel.)  Luke, in expanding on this same Q context,\\ngoes on to have Jesus say. \"Even sinners love those who love them.\" [6:27]\\nAll of this suggests [quite strongly, I\\'d say :-)] that *limiting* the\\nscope of the \"new commandment\" is not quite what Jesus has in mind.  In\\nshort, inference *leads me* to generalizing the actual text to a command\\nthat is \"in force\" on Christians, and with objects not limited to other\\nChristians.\\n\\nTrickier than the _agapate allelou_ or Institution of communion, there is\\nthe case of the \"Great Commission\" where (Matthew 10, Mark 6) the Twelve\\nare sent out to evangelize, \"Proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close\\nat hand.\"  The verb is imperative (_ke:russete_), but the context is rather\\nspecific to the Twelve, and there are further specifiers (as in \"Do not\\nturn your steps to pagan territory, and do not enter any Samaritan town\"\\n-- the Lukan parallels are even more specific to Jesus\\' final journey to\\nJerusalem) which make it harder to see this generalizing to all Christians\\nthan the previous examples.  That hasn\\'t prevented Christians from MAKING\\nsuch an inference; what I have to call attention to is that such inference\\nis NOT justified in the text, nor (unlike the first two cases I cite) by\\nthe rhetoric of the evangelist urged on the reader.  Still, Paul seems to\\nhave felt obliged to \"proclaim that the kingdom of heaven is close at hand\"\\neven (contrary to Jesus\\' instructions to the 12 :-)) to the gentiles, to\\nthe ends of the earth.  So, Christians after him have also taken this as\\na \"commandment\" in the sense of John 14:15.  Do I \"accept\" this?  I don\\'t\\nknow.  It is surely rather speculative.  But you see how the ripples of\\ninference spread out from the text that is the pretext -- Christians (may)\\ninfer a general commandment, applicable to all, from what is presented in\\nthe gospels as a specific occasion.  I do not (necessarily) object to this\\nkind of generalization -- but I *insist* that people who make it *must*\\nhave an understanding that they are *reasoning* (at some considerable\\nlength) from what we actually *have* in scripture.  There are *assumptions*\\ninvolved in this reasoning, and *these* are *not* themselves scriptural\\n(though people will do their best to \"justify\" their assumptions by OTHER\\nreferences to scripture -- which simply adds MORE inference into the mix!)\\n\\nLet\\'s move on to the \"Great Commandment\" -- that we should love God with\\nour whole hearts and minds and souls.  This is, perhaps, the Synoptic\\n\"equivalent\" of John\\'s _agapate allelou_.  And yet,  it is not PRESENTED\\nas a commandment, in our texts.  Rather, the context is controversy with\\nthe Pharisees.  To cite Matthew [22:34ff]\\n\\n\\t\"But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees\\n\\tthey got together and, to disconcert him, one of them put a question,\\n\\t\"Master, which is the greatest commandment of the Law?\"\\n\\nIt is by no means obvious here (though I accept it as such) that Jesus\\'\\nanswer is meant to be a commandment *to Christians*.  He is answering a\\npolemic from his enemies.  [ Mark\\'s account, in  12:28-34 casts the answer\\nin a far more positive light as (so the \"scribe\" in this version says)\\n\"far more important than any holocaust (I need to point out that this word\\noriginates in the context of animal sacrifice; forget the Nazis for this)\\nor sacrifice.\"  Luke is intermediate -- he has a lawyer posing the question\\n\"to disconcert\" Jesus, and gets the Good Samarian parable for his pains\\n[ Luke 10:25-37 ].  The contexts here are so confusingly various that one\\ncould be forgiven for drawing *no* inferences :-)  In *no* account is this\\nsaid as if it were obviously to be taken as a commandment binding on\\nChristians -- though I think it an entirely reasonable conclusion in each\\ncase that Jesus thinks it to be so.  The point is that our mental gears\\nHAVE to grind a cycle or so to get to any conclusion from all of this about\\nwhat WE are commanded to do, by Jesus.  And all of this is contingent on\\nour understanding the point of Jesus\\' use of the Torah in the (all quite\\ndifferent) gospel accounts, and the application of such a context to *us*.\\n\\nThe different contexts among the Synoptics are curious.  It should be noted\\nthat ONLY in Luke do we get the \"fixing\" of this command by the parable of\\nthe Good Samaritan.  We may look for an analogous *intent* in Matthew, where\\n7:12 gives the \"Golden Rule\" as \"the meaning of the Law and the Prophets\"\\n(and where we may also hear an echo of Hillel saying the same, a generation\\nbefore Jesus.)  If we make these associations (which I think are entirely\\nreasonable), we are -- again -- indulging in inference.  The texts do not\\n*explicitly* support us; rather, we *read* the texts as having this kind of\\ninter-relationship.  Current literary theory calls this \"intertextuality.\"\\n\\nMy discussion of why the _agapate allelou_ \"has\" to apply beyond the \\ncommunity of the disciples, and beyound the circle of Christian believers,\\napplies again here, to buttress a conclusion that this *is* (despite the\\npresentation not saying so explicitly) a \"commandment\" to Christians.\\nFew Christians would disagree with my conclusions -- but I *must* point\\nout that they *are* conclusions, they *depend* on rather elaborate chains\\nof reasoning that are simply NOT present in the texts, themselves.\\n\\nThe contextual problem keeps coming up, more and more severely as we look at\\nthose sayings of Jesus that are NOT so universally taken by Christians as \\ncommandments.  And we get some really hard cases.  Take divorce.  Mark is \\npretty clear, \"The man who divorces his wife and marries another is guilty\\nof adultery against her.\"  [ 10:11, cf. Luke 16:18 ] -- except that Matthew\\nhas an escape clause [ \"except in the case of fornication\", 5:31 ]. This\\nseems to be a rather clear \"commandment\" (whether or not we take Matthew\\'s\\nreservation); and some Christians, to this day, take it so.  But some don\\'t,\\nat least in practice.  This is rather peculiar; it is not as if Jesus were\\nnot explicit about this (whereas He says nothing at all about some of the\\nthings people gnash their teeth over.)  How is it possible, if the commands\\nof Christ are clear, that Matthew can so disagree with the other evangelists\\nof the synoptic tradition?\\n\\nI\\'m going to continue this examination, into ever-murkier waters, but this\\nis enough to start with.  The theme is: \"finding commandments in scripture\\nis an exercise in inference; our inferences are informed by OUR assumptions,\\nthat is, our own cultural biases.\"  I have, so far, identified a very few\\n\"commandments\" that are generally accepted by all Christians -- and yet in\\nthese, already, some of the difficulties start to surface.  It is these\\ndifficulties I want to discuss in my next essay on this topic.  The divorce\\ncommandment already strikes at some of the difficulties: I see almost no\\nevidence that the people who are so eager to find commandments to condemn\\n*me* with, spend any time at all writing nasty screeds to soc.couples or\\nmisc.legal about the horrors or viciousness of divorce, or demanding that\\nUS law refuse to allow it, or refuse \"unrepentant divorcees\" places in\\ntheir churches.  [ That is not to say that divorce *doesn\\'t* enter into \\nconsideration in general -- it is most definitely a matter of concern, in\\neven the most \"liberal\" church circles.  For example, a (wildly) liberal\\nEpiscopalian priest of my aqauintence, in a (wildly) liberal diocese, has\\nrecommended to a couple who approached him to marry them that they have a\\n\"private\" secular ceremony before a judge, so that the \"public\" ceremony\\nhe celebrated need not go through an agonizing \"examination\" by officials\\nwho would just as soon NOT take on this role of interpreting the commands\\nwe are faced with as Christians.  This, in a church that was effectively\\nCREATED by a famous divorce! ]',\n",

From the time he is born, the\\n     theist is brought up with the notion of the\\n     \"truth\" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible,\\n     the Torah, the Qur\\'an, & etc.  He is told\\n     of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired)\\n     the scripture, of the prophets talked about in\\n     the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc.\\n     He is also told that to question this (as\\n     children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime\\n     against God, and to lose belief in the scrip-\\n     ture\\'s truth is to damn one\\'s soul to Hell.\\n     Thus, by the time he is able to read the\\n     scripture for himself, the belief in its \"truth\"\\n     is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a\\n     matter of course.\\n     \\nBut it doesn\\'t stop there.

       "  \"More people have been asking for information on the Kubota graphics\\nworkstations, so here is some more info on the Kenai/Denali vs. the\\nE&S Freedom.\\n\\n\\nHere is the text of a Denali vs. E&S Freedom done by D.H. Brown Associates.\\n\\n------\\n\\nDenali bears a strong resemblance to Evans and Sutherlands Freedom graphics\\nsubsystem in several aspects of its high-level design.  Both products use\\na parallel array of 29050 processors for geometric computations.  Both\\nhave a pixel router to connect this front end to a second array of\\npixel processors.  As a result, Denali and Freedome overlap significantly\\nin performance and functionality.  Both design teams also appear to have \\nsimilar philosophies with respect to modularity, scalability, and market\\npenetration.\\n\\nThere remain, however, several important differences between the KPC and\\nE&S products.  Evans and Sutherland designed Freedom as a high-end\\ndeveloper's dream system with plenty of performance potential and\\nflexibility.  In its favor, Freedom has configurations from two to\\nsixteen floating point units, a border range that starts and ends at\\na higher price and performance levels than Denali.  All Freedom\\nsystems include a large, fixed number of pixel processors that\\nsupport a broader variety of color blending functions.  The Freedom\\ndesign treats its entire image memory as general-purpose memory, allowing\\ndevelopers to allocate it on a flexible basis to a number of special-purpose\\napplications.  Finally, E&S provided Freedom with very flexible otput and\\nvideo integration features for multimedia and simulation applications.  Note\\nthat KPC is working an auxiliary board for NTSC and PAL output that will not\\nrequire an external video encoder.  E&S programmable output features,\\nhowever, will remain much more flexible.\\n\\nThe KPC design team, in contrast, made Denali more of an end-user's system.\\nEntry version have better performance range and flexibility than low-end\\nFreedom configurations, and come in at more realistic mainstream price\\npoints.  Denali does not need as many 29050 modules as Freedome because\\nit uses a deeper scan-conversion pipeline to support each one, resulting\\nin better cost/performance characteristics.  Although both products provide\\nstrong support for 3D, imaging, and volume rendering, KPC recognized that\\nnot all users will want an even mix of these capabilities.  Denali's\\nconfiguration flexibility allows customers in effect to purchase\\ngeometric and pixel processing capabilities separately, and to upgrade\\nthem separately as needed.\\n\\nBoth companies have implemented hardware texture mapping at\\nworkstation price levels as a way to attack SGI's more expensive\\nVGXT and RealityEngine systems -- the only other products to provide\\nthis capability.  KPC supports point sampling and bilinear interpolation\\nof textures in hardware, but provides only software support for the higher\\nqualtiy tri-linear interpolated mipmapping method.  On balance, however, Denali\\nprovideds bettern overall texturing capabilities than E&S for most applications.\\nAside from being much more affordable, KPC solutions deliver more parallelism\\nfor texture processing and more off-screen memory for general graphics\\ndata storage.  By implementing texture mapping on its transformation\\nmodules, E&S foces customers to move very quickly to higher price levels\\nto obtain better texturing performance.  Kubota avoids this problem by linking\\ntexturing to its Frame Buffer Modules, providing a lower-cost, more scalable\\nsolution.\\n\\nHope this helps,\\n\\nBrian\",\n",

I suggest\\nthat the weakness is your reference material.  Get \"An Introduction to Ray\\nTracing\" by Andrew Glassner for very good coverage of the raytracing\\nalgorithm.  You could also refer to the 2nd edition of Foley & Van Dam.\\n\\n    On to the question.  The simple answer is that you just keep adding up\\nall the contributions and then clamping at the maximum intensity.  For\\nexample, if your intensity values range from 0.0 to 1.0, then keep adding up\\nand clamp the resultant values to 1.0 (you might have to clamp the lower\\nbound to 0.0 if you have dark bulbs, but that\\'s another issue =^).  So, you\\nget some illumination equation like this:\\n\\n        I = Lambient + Ldiffuse(light[n]) + Lreflected + Ltransparent\\n\\n    The contribution due to reflection is just summed with the light\\nintensity, as is the light due to transparency.  Now, a slightly less\\nhand-waving illumination equation is this:\\n\\n        I = KaLa + KdLd(light[n]) + KrLr + KtLt\\n\\n    That is, each component of the illumination equation is governed by the\\nmaterial constants Ka, Kd, Kr and Kt.

There are other\\nalgorithms, but this one works well and is fairly simple.  Implementations\\nare included in most raster toolkits (see item 7 below).\\n\\nA variant method is described in \"Graphics Gems\", p. 287-293.  Note that\\nthe code from the \"Graphics Gems\" series is all available from an FTP site,\\nas described above.\\n\\nCheck out John Bradley\\'s \"Diversity Algorithm\", which is incorporated into\\nthe xv package and described in the back of the manual.\\n\\nThe ImageMagick package (see section 7 for where it is) contains another\\nquantizing algorithm which is presented as \"doing a better job than the\\nother algorithms, but slower\".\\n\\nThere\\'s also an implementation of:\\n\\nWan, Wong, and Prusinkiewicz, _An Algorithm for Multidimensional Data\\nClustering_, Transactions on Mathematical Software, Vol. 14 #2 (June, 1988),\\npp. 153-162.\\n\\navialable as princeton.edu:pub/Graphics/colorquant.shar.  This code,\\nin modified form, appears in the Utah Raster Toolkit as well.\\n\\n\\n4) Converting color into grayscale.\\n\\nThe NTSC formula is:\\n\\n    luminosity = .299 red + .587 green + .114 blue\\n\\n\\n5) Quantizing grayscale to black&white.\\n\\nThe only reference you need for this stuff is:\\n\\n    Digital Halftoning, Robert Ulichney, MIT Press 1987, ISBN 0-262-21009-6\\n\\nBut before you go off and start coding, check out the image manipulation\\nsoftware mentioned in item 7 below.  All of the packages mentioned can do\\nsome form of gray to b&w conversion.\\n\\n\\n6) Rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle.\\n\\nThe obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source\\nimage, transform each coordinate, and copy the pixel to the destination.\\nThis is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination.  Instead,\\nloop over the pixels in the destination image, apply the *reverse*\\ntransformation to the coordinates, and copy that pixel from the source.\\nThis method is quite general, and can be used for any one-to-one\\n2-D mapping, not just rotation.  You can add anti-aliasing by doing\\nsub-pixel sampling.\\n\\nHowever, there is a much faster method, with antialising included,\\nwhich involves doing three shear operations.  The method was originally\\ncreated for the IM Raster Toolkit (see below); an implementation is\\nalso present in PBMPLUS.  Reference: \"A Fast Algorithm for Raster\\nRotation\", by Alan Paeth (awpaeth@watcgl.waterloo.edu) Graphics\\nInterface \\'86 (Vancouver).  An article on the IM toolkit appears in\\nthe same journal.  An updated version of the rotation paper appears\\nin \"Graphics Gems\" (see section [1]) under the original title.\\n\\n\\n7) Free image manipulation software.\\n\\nThere are a number of toolkits for converting from one image format to\\nanother, doing simple image manipulations such as size scaling, plus\\nthe above-mentioned 24 -> 8, color -> gray, gray -> b&w conversions.\\nHere are pointers to some of them:\\n\\n    xv by John Bradley.

See item 13 below for\\ndetails on some.\\n\\nAlso, the newsgroup alt.graphics.pixutils is specifically for discussion\\nof software like this.  You may find useful information there.\\n\\n\\n8) Format documents for TIFF, IFF, BIFF, NFF, OFF, FITS, etc.\\n\\nYou almost certainly don\\'t need these.  Read the above item 7 on free\\nimage manipulation software.  Get one or more of these packages and\\nlook through them.  Chances are excellent that the image converter you\\nwere going to write is already there.  But if you still want one of the\\nformat documents, many such files are available by anonymous ftp from\\nzamenhof.cs.rice.edu in directory pub/graphics.formats.\\n\\nThese files were collected off the net and are believed to be correct.\\nThis archive includes pixel formats, and two- and three-dimensional object\\nformats.  The future of this archive is uncertain at the moment, as Mark\\nHall <foo@cs.rice.edu> will apparently no longer be maintaining it.\\n\\nA second graphics file format archive is now being actively maintained\\nby Quincey Koziol (koziol@ncsa.uiuc.edu).  The latest version exists at\\nftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu in /misc/file.formats/graphics.formats.  Apparently,\\nneither of these is complete, you might want to check both.\\n\\nFITS stands for Flexible Image Transport System. It\\'s a file format most\\noften used in astronomy.  Despite the name, it can contain not only images\\nbut other things as well.  There is a regular monthly FITS basics and\\ninformation posting on sci.astro.fits - read it if you want to know more.\\n\\n\\n\\n9) Converting between vector formats.\\n\\nA lot of people ask about converting from HPGL to PostScript, or MacDraw\\nto CGM, or whatever.  It is important to understand that this is a very\\ndifferent problem from the image format conversions in item 7.  Converting\\none image format to another is a fairly easy problem, since once you\\nget past all the file header junk, a pixel is a pixel -- the basic objects\\nare the same for all image formats.  This is not so for vector formats.\\nThe basic objects -- circles, ellipses, drop-shadowed pattern-filled\\nround-cornered rectangles, etc. -- vary from one format to another.\\nExcept in extremely restricted cases, it is simply not possible to do\\na one-to-one conversion between vector formats.\\n\\nThere is software for converting to and from CGM files on ftp.psc.edu.  The\\ncontributor states that it runs on Unix, MS-Windows, and possibly the Mac.\\nA better, more specific blurb would be most welcome.\\n\\nOn the other hand, it is quite possible to do a close approximation,\\nrendering an image from one format using the primitives from another.\\nAs far as I know, no one has put together a general toolkit of such\\nconverters, but two different HPGL to PostScript converters have been\\nposted to comp.sources.misc.  Check the index on your nearest archive\\nsite.\\n\\nA related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format\\nto a bitmapped image - from PostScript to Sun raster format, or HPGL to\\nX11 bitmap.  For example, some of the commercial PostScript clones for\\nPC\\'s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer.  Also,\\nthe PostScript interpreters in the NeXT box and in Sun\\'s X11/NeWs can\\nbe used to render to a file if you\\'re clever.  But in general, the\\nanswer is no.  However, if someone were to put together a vector to\\nvector conversion toolkit, adding a vector to raster converter would be\\ntrivial.\\n\\nGNU ghostscript (from the FSF - current version 2.5.2) includes\\ndrivers for both ppm and gif format files, thus it can be used as\\na PostScript to ppm  or a PostScript to GIF filter.  (It implements\\nessentially all of PostScript level 1 and alot of Display PostScript\\nand level 2).\\n\\n\\n10) How to get Pixar films.\\n\\nThe various John Lasseter / Pixar computer animated shorts are available\\non video tape.  You can order them from Direct Cinema Limited:\\n\\n    Film                           Individual Price      Institutional Price\\n    Luxo, Jr.\\t\\t\\t\\t$14.95\\t\\t\\t$50.00\\n    Red\\'s Dream\\t\\t\\t\\t$19.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    Tin Toy\\t\\t\\t\\t$24.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    Knickknack\\t\\t\\t\\t$24.95\\t\\t\\t$75.00\\n    Luxo, Jr./Red\\'s Dream/Tin Toy\\t$39.95\\t\\t\\t$100.00\\n\\nAll tapes are on 1/2\" VHS NTSC.

For institutional orders, add $5 S&H\\nfor the first tape, $3 for each additional tape.  Foreign shipping, add\\n$3/tape or shirt.  Call 800-525-0000 (213-396-4774 international,\\n213-396-3233 FAX) to charge to your credit card.  Call first to verify\\nprices and availability.  Or, just write to:\\n\\n    Direct Cinema Limited\\n    1749 14th Street\\n    Santa Monica, CA 90404-4342\\n\\nAllan Braunsdorf has this to say:\\n\\nAt SIGGRAPH they were selling a tape with all four shorts\\nfor $25.  That was a sale price.  You can get it for slightly\\nmore than that normally.  ($35 maybe.)  I believe it\\'s\\navailable from RenderMan Retail (at Pixar\\'s address).\\n\\n    Pixar\\n    1001 West Cutting Blvd.\\n    Richmond, CA. 94804\\n    (510) 236-4000 \\n    (510) 236-0388 (FAX)\\n\\nYou can obtain a video directly from Pixar which contains \"Luxo, Jr.\", \"Red\\'s\\nDream\", \"Tin Toy\" and \"Knicknack\" for $25.00, plus $2.50 for shipping. They\\nwill take your order over the phone or via FAX with a major credit card. I \\nordered mine just last week and received it several days later. Don\\'t expect \\nto be able to rent a copy from your local video store. According to the license\\nagreement printed on the back cover of the case, it cannot be rented.\\n\\n\\n11) How do I draw a circle as a Bezier (or B-spline) curve?\\n\\nThe short answer is, \"You can\\'t.\"  Unless you use a rational spline you\\ncan only approximate a circle.  The approximation may look acceptable,\\nbut it is sensitive to scale.  Magnify the scale and the error of\\napproximation magnifies.  Deviations from circularity that were not\\nvisible in the small can become glaring in the large.  If you want to\\ndo the job right, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"A Menagerie of Rational B-Spline Circles\"\\n  by Leslie Piegl and Wayne Tiller\\n  in IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, volume 9, number 9,\\n  September, 1989, pages 48-56.\\n\\nFor rough, non-rational approximations, consult the book:\\n\\n  Computational Geometry for Design and Manufacture\\n  by I. D. Faux and M. J. Pratt,\\n  Ellis Horwood Publishers, Halsted Press, John Wiley 1980.\\n\\nFor the best known non-rational approximations, consult the article:\\n\\n  \"Good Approximation of Circles by Curvature-continuous Bezier Curves\"\\n  by Tor Dokken, Morten Daehlen, Tom Lyche, and Knut Morken\\n  in Computer Aided Geometric Design, volume 7, numbers 1-4 (combined),\\n  June, 1990, pages 33-41 [Elsevier Science Publishers (North-Holland)]\\n\\n\\n12) How to order standards documents.\\n\\nThe American National Standards Institute sells ANSI standards, and also\\nISO (international) standards.  Their sales office is at 1-212-642-4900,\\nmailing address is 1430 Broadway, NY NY 10018.  It helps if you have the\\ncomplete name and number.\\n\\nSome useful numbers to know:\\n\\nCGM (Computer Graphics Metafile) is ISO 8632-4 (1987).  GKS (Graphical\\nKernel System) is ANSI X3.124-1985.  PHIGS (Programmer\\'s Hierarchical\\nInteractive Graphics System) is ANSI X3.144-1988.  IGES is ASME/ANSI\\nY14.26M-1987.  Language bindings are often separate but related numbers;\\nfor example, the GKS FORTRAN binding is X3.124.1-1985.\\n\\nStandards-in-progress are made available at key milestones to solicit\\ncomments from the graphical public (this includes you!).  ANSI can let\\nyou know where to order them; most are available from Global Engineering\\nat 1-800-854-7179.\\n\\n\\n13) How to FTP by email.\\n\\nThere are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups\\nand make them available via an email query system.  You send a message\\nto an automated server saying something like \"send comp.sources.unix/fbm\",\\nand a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.\\n\\nIn addition, there is at least one FTP-by-mail server.  Send mail to\\nftpmail@decwrl.dec.com saying \"help\" and it will tell you how to use\\nit.  Note that this service has at times been turned off due to abuse.\\n\\n\\n14) How to tell whether a point is within a planar polygon.\\n\\nConsider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to\\ninfinity.  If it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way,\\nthe point is within the polygon.  If the ray crosses an even number of\\nedges, the point is either outside the polygon, or within an interior\\nhole formed from intersecting polygon edges.  This idea is known in\\nthe trade as the Jordan curve theorem; see Eric Haines\\' article in\\nGlassner\\'s ray tracing book (above) for more information, including\\ntreatment of special cases.\\n\\nAnother method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all\\nthe vertices on the polygon.  If the sum is 2 pi, the point is inside,\\nif the sum is 0 the point is outside.  However, this method is about an\\norder of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the\\ntrigonometric functions is usually quite costly.\\n\\nCode for both methods (plus barycentric triangle testing) can be found in\\nthe Ray Tracing News, Vol. 5, No. 3, available from princeton.edu:\\npub/Graphics/RTNews/RTNv5n3.Z.\\n\\n\\n15) How to tessellate a sphere.\\n\\nOne simple way is to do recursive subdivision into triangles.  The\\nbase of the recursion is an octahedron, and then each level divides\\neach triangle into four smaller ones.

It is portable and usable upon\\na wide variety of platforms.  It is quite limited in some ways (yes, the\\nkeeper of the FAQ has some opinions after all), and in fact, I don\\'t like\\nit much.  However, it looks to me like the most-Frequently Asked Question\\nwhich was not previously covered in this list.  The following is a list\\nof newsgroups and the like where one could go to find out about GIF.\\n\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - General info\\nSubject: alt.binaries.pictures FAQ - OS specific info\\nNewsgroups: alt.binaries.pictures.d,alt.binaries.pictures.misc,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.utilities,alt.binaries.pictures.fractals,\\n\\talt.binaries.pictures.fine-art.d,news.answers\\n\\nAvailable in the indicated USENET newsgroup(s), or via anonymous ftp from\\npit-manager.mit.edu in the files:\\n\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nAlso available from mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu by sending a mail\\nmessage containing any or all of:\\n\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part1\\nsend usenet/news.answers/pictures-faq/part2\\n\\nSend a message containing \"help\" to get general information about the\\nmail server.\\n\\nAlso, you could check out the resources described in sections 7, 8, and\\n20 above for more information.\\n\\n\\n22) What is morphing?\\n\\nWarping is the deformation of an image by mapping each pixel to a new\\nlocation. Morphing is blending from one image or object to another one.\\nValerie Hall has written an excellent introduction to warping and\\nmorphing. This is available for anonymous ftp from marsh.cs.curtin.edu.au\\nin the directory pub/graphics/bibliography/Morph. There are three files:\\n\\n        morph_intro.ps.Z     (PostScript version, many pictures - 1.5M)\\n        morph_intro.txt.Z    (text version)\\n        m_responses.Z        (Responses to morphing questions)\\n\\nThe files are compressed, so you must use binary transfer and\\nuncompress them afterwards.\\n\\n\\n23) How to ray-trace height fields\\n\\nHeight fields are a special case in ray-tracing.  They have a number of uses,\\nsuch as terrain rendering, and some optimization is possible.  Thus, they\\nget their own FAQ section.  Note that further references can no doubt be\\nlocated via the ray-tracing bibs in section 16 above.\\n\\nThe following paper seems to be the definitive reference:\\n\\nF.

For every twenty or so\\nnewspaper, magazine articles, interviews etc. supporting Rushdie, there\\nwould\\nappear one Muslim voice. This person was usually selected based on how\\ndramatic and incoherent he was, not on his knowledge of Islam or the\\nsituation at the time. This approx. twenty to one ratio continued\\nthroughout the escalation of the crisis, with Rushdie in the central\\nspotlight as the man of the moment, the valiant defender of everyman\\'s\\nright to free speech decoupled from responsibility. (As an aside, it\\'s\\ninteresting that while the hue and cry about freedom of speech went up,\\nsome books (defaming certain ethnic and religious groups) continued\\nto be banned here. It was felt that they injured the sensibilities of these\\n\\ngroups and presented a false image which could promote feelings of \\nhate towards these groups. For Muslims this kind of double standard \\nwas annoying.)\\n\\nRushdie saw this spotlight as a golden opportunity to lash out at\\n\"organized\"\\nIslam, and he did so with admirable verbal skill. The only kind of Islam\\nwhich Rushdie finds palatable is what he calls a \"secular\" Islam - an Islam\\nseparated from it\\'s Qur\\'an, it\\'s Prophet, God, its legislation, and most\\nimportantly from any intrusion into any political arena. Fine - Rushdie\\nmade\\nhis views known - the Muslim\\'s made their anger at his book known. The\\nscale of the whole affair erupted into global proportions - it was, by this\\ntime,\\nalready a political situation - affecting governments as well as\\nindividuals.\\nThe situation was a serious one, with far-reaching political implications.\\nAt the centre of this turmoil was Rushdie, throwing fuel on the fire -\\nengaged\\nin a personal crusade that made him oblivious to any sense of caution.\\n\\nNow you may feel that the person in the centre of a worldwide storm such as\\n\\nthis has no responsibility, has no reason to exercise restraint of any\\nkind, has no\\nobligation to perhaps step back momentarily out of the spotlight till\\nmatters calm down. Perhaps you even feel that he is justified in \"boldly\"\\ndefying the anger of all those who dare to take umbrage at his literary\\nwork, no matter what insult they find within it. Perhaps you see him as\\na kind of secular \"heroic Knight\",mounted on the his media steed,\\n doing battle with the \"dragon\" of Islamic \"fundamentalism\".\\n\\nWell Khomeini saw him as a disingeneous author who \\ngrew up in a Muslim atmosphere, knew well what Muslim\\'s hold dear, \\nwho wrote a book which mischievously uses certain literary conventions\\nto slander, insult, and attack Islam and its most notable personalities -\\nwho, when\\nfaced with a situation that became a worldwide crisis, continued with\\nhis mischief in the world stage of the media - who, even after people were\\ninjured and killed because of the magnitude and emotion of the situation,\\ncontinued his mischief, instead of having the good sense to desist.\\nKhomeini saw the crisis as mischief making on a grand scale, mischief\\nmaking that grew in scale as the scale of the crisis enlarged. The deaths\\nof Muslims around the world and Rushdie\\'s continued media mischief\\neven after this, was the triggering factor that seemed to\\ndecide Khomeini on putting a stop to the mischief. The person at the\\ncentre of all these events was Rushdie - he was the source of the\\ncontinuing mischief - all media support, government support was\\njust that - support. The source was Rushdie (and his publishers, who\\nwere nothing short of ecstatic at the publicity and were very happy\\nto see Rushdie constantly in the media). The Islamic rulings that\\ndeal with people who engage in this kind of grand-scale mischief\\nmaking, was applied to Rushdie.\\n\\n\\nI have made no attempts at justification, only at explanation. \"Image\" is\\nthe chief concern of Muslim \\'apologists\\' for Islam and for Rushdie.\\nIf Muslims willingly relegated themselves to becoming a sub-culture\\nwithin a larger secular culture, such that the secular principles and laws\\nhad precedence over the laws of Islam - then I have no doubt that Islam\\nwould then be thought to have a good \"image\" (Principally because it would\\nby and large reflect the secular image). A \"good image\" usually means \" be\\nmore\\nlike me\".\\n\\nYour attempts at TOTALLY exonerating Rushdie reflect exactly the attitude\\nthat\\nresulted in the polarization brought about by the crisis.\\n',\n",

Indeed, by your definition, an\\nobjective x is an oxymoron, for all x.  I have no quibble with that\\nbelief, other than that it is useless, and that \"objective\" is a perfectly\\ngood word.\\n\\n#> So, what *is* objective?

How many different\\n#moral systems can different members of society have - indeed, single\\n#individuals, in some cases - and humanity still stick together?\\n\\nBegging the question.  People can have many opinions about the age\\nof the universe and humanity can still stick together.   You are\\nsaying that the universe has a _real_ age, independent of my beliefs about\\nit.  Why?\\n\\n#      The age of the universe, like most scientific facts, can be\\n#emirically verified through means that\\'ll give the same result no matter\\n#who performs the testing (albeit there are error bars that may be on the\\n#largish side...). \\n\\nThis assumes that the universe has a real age, or any kind of reality\\nwhich doesn\\'t depend on what we think.   Why should an extreme Biblical\\nCreationist give a rat\\'s ass about the means of which you speak?\\n\\n#I\\'ve heard of no way to verify morality in a\\n#consistent way, much less compute the errors of the measurement; care to\\n#enlighten me?\\n\\nThe same is true of pain, but painkillers exist, and can be predicted\\nto work with some accuracy better than a random guess.

       "  '\\nZoroaster is far older than Daniel. If anything, one could claim that,\\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \\nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\\n\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\\n\\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\\nsalvation from death in a lion\\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\\'s\\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\\'s transformation into a beast, a story that\\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\\nmartyr\\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.',\n",

       "  'I feel compelled to complain: the statement that recent observations\\nrule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma-ray bursts is\\nutterly false, even though it is popular enough to make it to\\nBATSE press releases.\\nThe idea behind the statement is as follows: \\n     \"if you smack two neutron\\n      stars together, or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole,\\n      a lot of energy is released, enough for a gamma-ray burst at a\\n      cosmological distance. But, so the reasoning continues, this energy \\n      is released below a lot of matter, so the radiation becomes\\n      thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum.\\n      The observed spectra are strongly non-thermal, so this model must\\n      be wrong.\"\\nAs so often, the fault lies with the imagination of the person who\\nwas trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model. It\\nmay be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma-ray\\nburst, but the \\'fireball\\' of energy and matter that is created\\nmay spew out a relativistic flow. When this slams into the surrounding \\nmedium, a strong flux of non-thermal gamma rays results, which may\\ncarry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy. All\\nthis is not my idea: it is in a series of papers by Martin Rees,\\nPeter Meszaros (sorry for the missing accents:-) and co-workers.\\nIt is certainly not a complete model, but it may well be the best one\\naround (summing over all proposed distance scales). An alternative\\nproposal for what creates the initial fireball, by the way, is the \\nso-called \\'failed supernovae\\' scenario by Stan Woosley, in which\\na very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black\\nhole. If the stellar core was rotating, part of the infalling matter\\nwill be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal\\nforce, and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the\\nblack hole. This beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis,\\nwhich again constitutes relativistic flow. The rate of such\\nevents may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers,\\nbut the flux may be more strongly beamed, so that the net rate\\nof bursts observed on Earth stays the same between the two\\nscenarios, but the energy released per event can be a lot less\\nin the failed supernova scenario.\\n\\nOn another note: I do believe that the distance scale must \\nultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method\\nsuch as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths,\\nor finding a definitive signature of some known class of\\nobjects in the distribution of positions and fluxes.

       "  '\\n\\nI can\\'t see the need for a single (big? expensive? heavy?) \"mothership\" except\\nfor Voyager style flyby missions. A few years ago, I did some calculations on a\\n\"Grand Tour\" space probe launched by a Saturn V in 1975-76. At the time,I felt \\nthat\\nthe idea of a big \"mother ship\" had some merit - the Voyagers had to be rather\\nsmall, lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak Titan\\nIII/Centaur launchers. The concept I examined (and Michael\\'s?) had a lot in\\ncommon with the British Interplanetary Society\\'s Daedalus project for sending a\\nprobe to Barnard\\'s Star - i.e. a large \"bus\" spacecraft carrying several\\nsmaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination.\\nThe Saturn V supposedly would have been able to launch a 10-ton payload towards\\nJupiter and beyond. The \"bus\" could have included far more powerful\\ncameras/telescopes/scientific equipment and a heavier/more powerful power\\nsource than the Voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore.\\nExtremely important as the Voyagers had to perform most of their measurements\\nwithin a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter, and usually at a\\nrelatively great distance.\\n---\\nThe smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the \"real\" Voyagers,\\nand an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards Pluto in\\nthe early 21st century, and would have been released at various points during\\nthe mission. The advantages are obvious: the bus would have carried out the\\nsame basic Jupiter-Saturn-Uranus-Neptune mission than Voyager 2 did, but in\\naddition two \"sub-probes\" could have been relased at Saturn, examining\\nthat planet\\'s south polar regions before moving on to Pluto. This would have\\nenabled NASA to map both hemispheres of Pluto/Charon by 1986...and several\\nother probes could have examined parts of the Jupiter/Saturn/Uranus/Neptune\\nsystems that weren\\'t examined in great detail by the Voyagers due to\\ntrajectory-related factors. A small \"swarm\" of camera-equipped miniature space\\nprobes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a \\nsmall Voyager-type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy, \\nwell-equipped spacecraft. And would we have learned a lot more about the outer\\nplanets! The reason why the Grand Tour was cancelled was lack of money, of\\ncourse. \\n\\nMARCU$',\n",

This\\nis obviously true in comparing it to practices of surrounding people,\\nfor instance: according to the Bible, the surrounding people were\\nimmoral savages with repulsive and inhuman habits.  We need to look\\nrather at what those peoples were *really* like.  For instance, in\\nwhat way is it better to worship a single god whose presence is\\nsymbolically strongest in a tent or temple over multiple gods some of\\nwhose presence is symbolically represented in a statue?  By the\\nBible\\'s own terms idolatry is inherently evil, but I see no evidence\\nthat the followers of the various other religions of the area and time\\nwere particularly bad people, relative to the people in the Bible.\\n\\n\\nSounds good, but it presupposes teeth-rending neighbors, which I see\\nno support for.  One can argue that post-facto assertion of inhumane\\nneighbors can be used to make moral points, but that doesn\\'t mean that\\nthe actual neighbors really were inhuman.  More to the point, such\\ndehumanization of the people across the river or over the mountain, or\\neven of a different people dwelling among us, is all too common.\\n\\n\\nNote that I\\'m speaking of historical interpretation here, for instance\\nclaiming that Hammurabi\\'s \"an eye for an eye\" was primitive brutal\\nretribution, while Moses\\' version was an enlightened benign fine\\n(because the tradition has since interpreted the phrase that way).  As\\nof 3000 years ago or so, they probably both meant the same thing.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t belittle the accomplishments, particularly the intellectual\\nones, of the Jewish people.

The OFF data is triangles at\\na specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).\\nThe SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a\\ntessellation at any specified resolution.\\n\\nb. Space Shuttle ?\\n------------------\\n\\nTolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle\\ndatafiles.

I\\'m not\\n  sure exactly what they are.\\n  You can ftp the idraw\\'s binary from interviews.stanford.edu.\\n\\nc. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)\\n  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats\\n  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert\\n  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.\\n  Tgif\\'s sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu\\n  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)\\n\\nd. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).\\n  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all\\n  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.\\n\\ne. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output\\n  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.\\n\\nf. \\'ice\\' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It\\'s a PostScript-based\\n  graphical editor,and it\\'s available for anonymous ftp from Internet host\\n  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12).

This was\\n  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working\\n  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL\\n  or would be willing to buy it.  It\\'s a few thousand dollars (American) I\\n  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general\\n  purpose packages I\\'ve heard of, besides what TerraMar has.\\n  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I\\'m not sure how general purpose\\n  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I\\n  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh\\n  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image\\n  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I\\'ve\\n  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best\\n  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large\\n  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That\\'s a\\n  freebie if you want it\"\\n\\n  \"My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,\\n  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its\\n  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It\\n  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing\\n  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even\\n  Excel on the Mac if it\\'s not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH\\n  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which\\n  that combination couldn\\'t handle, and the speed and ease of use\\n  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it\\'s mostly astronomical\\n  image processing which I\\'ve been doing. This means image enhancement,\\n  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image\\n  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity\\n  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve\\n  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) \"\\n\\n[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and\\n for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder .

GRASS is not very\\n  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software.\" A first review  of\\n  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel\\n  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose\\n  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in\\n  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the\\n  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric\\n  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective\\n  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus\\n  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them\\n  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68\\n\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh\\n  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for\\n  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC\\n  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,\\n  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster\\n  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it\\n  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented\\n  in raster (grid-cell) form.\\n\\n  Availability\\n\\n  CERL\\'s Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:\\n  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).\\n\\n  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to\\n  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  This location will be the new \"canonical\" source for GRASS software, as\\n  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.\\n  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and\\n  \"tar\" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John\\n  Parks\\' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,\\n  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review\\n  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently\\n  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be\\n  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu\\n\\n  Support\\n\\n  Listserv mailing lists:\\n\\n  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level\\n  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send\\n  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  grassp-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS programmers; system-level\\n  questions and tips, tricks, and techniques of design and implementation\\n  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to\\n  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.\\n\\n  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of\\n  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in\\n  Champaign, IL).

Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager\\n  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a\\n  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.\\n\\n  Feature Description\\n\\n  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.\\n  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a\\n  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).\\n  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.\\n  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering\\n  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,\\n  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages\\n  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band\\n  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.\\n\\n  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle\\n  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available\\n  for GIS applications.\\n  Host Configuration Requirements\\n\\n  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)\\n  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software\\n  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.\\n\\nPCI\\n---\\n  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes\\n  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of\\n  remote sensing data in eight or ten different \"industry standard\"\\n  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I\\n  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix\\n  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly\\n  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consists of several classes/groups/packages of\\n  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package is a set of utility\\n  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape\\n  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically\\n  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.\\n  \"multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5\"), and\\n  God only knows what all else -- there\\'s a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you only buy the packages your\\n  particular application/interest calls for.\\n\\n  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight \"parameters,\" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting\\n  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a\\n  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to\\n  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,\\n  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also\\n  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'s\\n  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled\\n  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structures (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but\\n  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle\\n  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a\\n  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh calls \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the\\n  graphic-arts industry\\'s \"CT2T\" format, would probably (I haven\\'t tried)\\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\'s worth noting that the PCI \"database\" file is designed to\\n  contain not only \"raster\" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map\\n  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often\\n  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this\\n  can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX\\n  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific\\n  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would\\n  display directly from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus\\n  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seems designed for the very \"high end\"\\n  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It\\'s\\n  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which\\n  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe\\n  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these\\n  areas.\\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis\\n  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed\\n  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels\\n  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since\\n  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging\\n  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.\\n\\n  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and\\n  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).\\n  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement\\n  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.\\n\\n  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may\\n  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame\\n  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you\\'re interested.  PCW requires X\\n  for display.\\n\\nMAP II\\n------\\n  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.\\n\\nCLRview\\n-------\\n  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit\\n  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.\\n\\n  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the\\n  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports\\n  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,\\n  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.\\n\\n  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129) \\n  in the directory pub/sgi/clrview.\\n\\n  Contact:\\n  Rodney Hoinkes\\n  Head of Design Applications\\n  Centre for Landscape Research\\n  University of Toronto\\n  Tel:   (416) 978-7197\\n  Email: rodney@dgp.utoronto.ca\\n\\n==========================================================================\\n\\nEnd of Resource Listing',\n",

       "  'FIRST ANNUAL PHIGS USER GROUP CONFERENCE\\n\\n          The First Annual PHIGS User Group Conference was held March 21-24\\n          in Orlando, Florida.  The conference was organized by the Rensse-\\n          laer Design Research Center in co-operation with  IEEE  and  SIG-\\n          GRAPH.   Attendees  came  from five countries spanning three con-\\n          tinents.   A  good  cross-section  of  the  PHIGS  community  was\\n          represented  at this conference with participants including PHIGS\\n          users, workstation vendors, third-party PHIGS implementors, stan-\\n          dards  committee  members,  and  researchers  from  industry  and\\n          academia.  The opening speaker, Dr. Richard Puk, challenged PHIGS\\n          users  to  \"take  charge of your PHIGS\" by participating in PHIGS\\n          standardization activities and communicating their needs to PHIGS\\n          implementors.    The   closing  speaker,  Dr.  Andries  Van  Dam,\\n          described his vision of the future of graphics standards  \"beyond\\n          PHIGS\".\\n\\n          Technical paper sessions in the conference covered the  following\\n          topics:  PHIGS  and  X, Application Toolkits, Application Issues,\\n          Texture Mapping, NURBS,  PHIGS  Extensions,  and  Object-Oriented\\n          Libraries and Frameworks.  Panel sessions on PHIGS and PEX, PHIGS\\n          Non-Retained Data, Real-World CAD Applications Using  PHIGS,  and\\n          Portability  Issues generated enthusiastic discussions and formed\\n          a good forum for exchange of ideas, needs, and experiences.   The\\n          conference  also included a day full of tutorials on topics rang-\\n          ing from mathematics for 3D  graphics  to  object-oriented  tools\\n          based on PHIGS.\\n\\n          Next year\\'s conference is planned for March, 1994.\\n\\n          PHIGS EVERYWHERE\\n\\n          At the conference, PHIGS  vendors   described   and  demonstrated\\n          PHIGS  products  that  run on all types of computers, from PCs to\\n          mainframes.\\n\\n          Megatek Corporation demonstrated their PHIGS extensions including\\n          conditional traversal, composite logical input devices, texturing\\n          and translucency.\\n\\n          Template Graphics  Software  launched  FIGARO+  PRO,  the  Photo-\\n          Realistic  Option  for  PHIGS+.

It\\'s from\\n\\n  P(H)  =  P(HG) +  P(HG\\')  where G\\' is the complement of G\\n\\nand by axiom, P(anything) >= 0, so P(HG\\') >= 0, so P(H) >= P(HG).\\n\\nIn a sense, HG is necessarily more \"complicated\" than H for any H and G,\\nso I may be splitting hairs, but what I\\'m trying to say is that irrespective\\nof subjective impressions of how complicated something is, P(H) >= P(HG)\\nholds, with equality if and only if P(HG\\') = 0.\\n\\n\\nWell, \"P(x | A) = P(x | B)\" means that x is as likely to be observed if A is\\noperative as it is if B is operative. This implies that observing x does not\\nprovide any useful information which might allow us to discriminate between\\nthe respective possibilities that A and B are operative; the difference\\nreduces to the difference between the (unknown and unhelpful) prior\\nprobabilities P(A) and P(B):\\n\\n  P(x | A) = P(x | B)  ==>\\n\\n    P(A | x)  =  k P(A),   and   P(B | x)  =  k P(B)\\n\\nwhere k  =  P(x | A) / P(x)  =  P(x | B) / P(x).\\n\\nSo A and B are \"equally consistent with the data\" in that observing x\\ndoesn\\'t give any pointers as to which of A or B is operative.\\n\\nIn the particular case where A = H and B = HG, however, we know that their\\nprior probabilities are ordered by P(H) >= P(HG), although we don\\'t know\\nthe actual values, and it\\'s this which allows us to deploy the Razor to\\nthrow out any such HG.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s certainly true, but the particular point here was whether or\\nnot a `divine component\\' actually underlies the prevalence of religion\\nin addition to the memetic transmission component, which even the religious\\nimplicitly acknowledge to be operative when they talk of `spreading the word\\'.\\n\\nNow it seems to me, as I\\'ve said, that the observed variance in religious\\nbelief is well accounted for by the memetic transmission model, but rather\\n*less* well if one proposes a `divine component\\' in addition, since I would\\nexpect the latter to conspire *against* wide variance and even mutual\\nexclusion among beliefs. Thus my *personal* feeling is that P(x | HG) isn\\'t\\neven equal to P(x | H) in this case, but is smaller (H is memetic transmission,\\nG is `divine component\\', x is the variance among beliefs). But I happily\\nacknowledge that this is a subjective impression.\\n\\n\\nNot that I\\'m a statistician as such either, but:\\n\\nThe idea is that both theism and atheism are compatible with all of\\nthe (read `my\\') observations to date. However, theism (of the type with\\nwhich I am concerned) *also* suggests that, for instance, prayer may be\\nanswered, people may be miraculously healed (both are in principle amenable\\nto statistical verification) and that god/s may generally intervene in\\nmeasurable ways.\\n\\nThis means that these regions of the space of possible observations, \\nwhich I loosely termed \"appearances of god/s\", have some nonzero\\nprobability under the theistic hypothesis and zero under the atheistic.\\n\\nSince there is only so much probability available for each hypothesis to\\nscatter around over the observation space, the probability which theism\\nexpends on making \"appearances of god/s\" possible must come from somewhere\\nelse (i.e. other possible observations).\\n\\nAll else being equal, this means that an observation which *isn\\'t* an\\n\"appearance of god/s\" must have a slightly higher probability under\\natheism than under theism. The Bayesian stuff implies that such\\nobservations must cause my running estimate for the probability of\\nthe atheistic hypothesis to increase, with a corresponding decrease\\nin my running estimate for the probability of the theistic hypothesis.\\n\\nSorry if that\\'s still a bit jargonesque, but it\\'s rather difficult to\\nput it any other way, since it does depend intimately on the properties\\nof conditional probability densities, and particularly that the total\\narea under them is always unity.\\n\\nAn analogy may (or may not :-) be helpful. Say that hypothesis A is \"the\\ncoin is fair\", and that B is \"the coin is unfair (two-headed)\". (I\\'ve\\nused A and B to avoid confusion with H[heads] and T[tails].)\\n\\nThen\\n\\n  P(H | A) = 0.5  }  total 1\\n  P(T | A) = 0.5  }\\n\\n  P(H | B) = 1    }  total 1\\n  P(T | B) = 0    }\\n\\nThe observations are a string of heads, with no tails. This is compatible\\nwith both a fair coin (A) and a two-headed coin (B). However, the probability\\nexpended by A on making possible the appearance of tails (even though they\\ndon\\'t actually appear) must come from somewhere else, since the total must\\nbe unity, and it comes in this case from the probability of the appearance\\nof heads.\\n\\nSay our running estimates at time n-1 are e[n-1](A) and e[n-1](B). The\\nobservation x[n] at time n is another head, x[n] = H. The estimates are\\nmodified according to\\n\\n                            P(H | A)\\n  e[n](A)   =   e[n-1](A) * --------   =   e[n-1](A) * m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nand\\n\\n                            P(H | B)\\n  e[n](B)   =   e[n-1](B) * --------   =   e[n-1](B) * 2m\\n                              P(H)\\n\\nNow we don\\'t know P(H), the *actual* prior probability of a head, but\\nthe multiplier for e(A) is half that for e(B). This is true every time\\nthe coin is tossed and a head is observed.\\n\\nThus whatever the initial values of the estimates, after n heads, we have\\n\\n                 n\\n  e[n](A)   =   m  e[0](A)\\n\\nand\\n                    n\\n  e[n](B)   =   (2m)  e[0](B),\\n\\nand since e[k](A) + e[k](B) = 1 at any time k, you can show that 0.5 < m < 1\\nand thus 1 < 2m < 2. Hence the estimate for the fair-coin hypothesis A must\\ndecrease at each trial and that for the two-headed coin hypothesis B must\\nincrease, even though both hypotheses are compatible with a string of heads.\\n\\nThe loose analogy is between \"unfair coin\" and atheism, and between \"fair\\ncoin\" and theism, with observations consistent with both. A tail, which\\nwould falsify \"unfair coin\", is analogous to an \"appearance of god/s\",\\nwhich would falsify atheism. I am *not* claiming that the analogy extends\\nto the numerical values of the various probabilities, just that the principle\\nis the same.\\n\\n\\n\\nQuite so, but this type of theism is what I might call \"the G in the HG\",\\nin terms of our Ockham\\'s Razor discussion, and I\\'d bin it on those grounds.\\n\\n\\nThe hypotheses don\\'t have to be falsifiable, and indeed in my `model\\',\\nthe theism isn\\'t falsifiable.\\n\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to. We don\\'t need, in the above analogy, to know *any*\\nprior probabilities to deduce that the updating multiplier for the\\nfair-coin hypothesis is less than unity, and that the corresponding\\nmultiplier for the two-headed coin hypothesis is greater than unity.\\nYou don\\'t need to know the initial values of the running estimates\\neither. It\\'s clear that after a large number of observations, P(fair-coin)\\napproaches zero and P(two-headed-coin) approaches unity.\\n\\nAll you need to know is whether P(x | Ha) is larger than P(x | Ht) for\\nobserved x, and this follows from the assumptions that there are certain\\nevents rendered *possible* (not necessary) under Ht which are not possible\\nunder Ha, and all else is equal.\\n\\n\\nAny observations you like; it really doesn\\'t matter, nor affect the\\nreasoning, provided that there are some possible observations which\\nwould count as \"appearances of god/s\". Examples of this might be\\na demonstration of the efficacy of prayer, or of the veracity of\\nrevelation.\\n\\n\\n\\nOK, we\\'ll downgrade \"*does* interact\" to \"*may* interact\", which would\\nactually be better since \"does interact\" implies a falsifiability which\\nwe both agree is misplaced.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll explain, but bear in mind that this isn\\'t central; all I require of\\na theism is that it *not* make the prediction \"Appearances of god/s will\\nnever happen\", as does atheism. (Before somebody points out that quantum\\nmechanics doesn\\'t make this prediction either, the difference is that\\nQM and atheism do not form a partition.)\\n\\nPredictions include such statements as \"Prayer is efficacious\" (implying\\n\"If you do the stats, you will find that Prayer is efficacious\"), or \"Prayer\\nis *not* efficacious\", or \"Verily I say unto you, This generation shall not\\npass, till all these things be fulfilled.\" I don\\'t think we have any problems\\nof misunderstanding here.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s fine; I don\\'t claim that theism is false, merely that the [finite\\nnumber of] observations available to me so far suggest that it is, and\\nthat as I continue to observe, the suggestion looks better and better.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI think you are; an \"appearance of god/s\" is sufficient to falsify\\natheism, whereas in general the corresponding theism is unfalsifiable.\\n\\n\\nNo: by way of a counterexample, let X = \"the coin is fair\", or more\\naccurately (so that not(X) makes sense) \"the two sides of the coin are\\ndifferent\". This is unfalsifiable by tossing the coin; even a string of\\nheads is consistent with a fair coin, and you have to go to an infinite\\nnumber of tosses to falsify X in the limit. Its converse is falsifiable,\\nand is falsified when at least one head and at least one tail have appeared.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOops. Sorry. Mea culpa.\\n\\n\\nWe agree here.\\n\\n\\n\"The Rapture will not happen on October 28 1992.\" Said Rapture would have\\nfalsified atheism to my satisfaction had it happened, although its failure\\nto happen does not, of course, falsify any theisms other than those which\\nspecifically predicted it.\\n\\n\"No phenomenon which requires the existence of one or more gods for its\\nexplanation will ever be observed.\" That about sums the whole thing up.\\n\\n\\nCheers\\n\\nSimon',\n",

This can be from reading simple truths \\n     in the Scriptures and by using the Bible to interpret the Bible.\\n\\nra> Who is that \"holds that\" Luke meant what you said he meant?\\n\\n     I think that it is apparent from reading the Scriptures that are\\n     pertinent.\\n\\n     Luke 23:43 records Christ\\'s promise to the repentant thief who hung on\\n     an adjacent cross: \"Truly I say to you, today you will be with Me in\\n     paradise.\" But was it not until later that Christ rose from the dead\\n     and ascended to heaven? If Christ Himself was not in heaven until\\n     Sunday, how could the repentant thief have been there with Him? The\\n     answer lies in the location of \"paradise\" when Jesus died.\\n\\n     Apparently paradise was not exalted to heaven until Easter Day.\\n\\n     Jesus refers to it in the middle of the story of the rich man and \\n     Lazarus as \"Abraham\\'s Bosom,\" to which the godly beggar Lazarus was\\n     carried by the angels after his decease (Luke 16:19-31).  Thus\\n     \"Abraham\\'s Bosom\" referred to the place where the souls of the redeemed\\n     waited till the day of Christ\\'s Resurrection.\\n\\n     It was not yet lifted to heaven but it may well have been a section of \\n     hades (Hebrew: Sheol), reserved for believers who had died in the faith\\n     but would not be admitted into the glorious presence of God in heaven\\n     until the price of redemption had actually been paid on Calvary; or\\n     even that none would precede the presence of Jesus back to glory with\\n     the Father.\\n\\n     Doubtless it was the infernal paradise that the souls of Jesus and the\\n     repentant thief repaired after they each died on Friday afternoon. But\\n     on Sunday, after the risen Christ had first appeared to Mary Magdalene\\n     (John 20:17) and her two companions (Matthew 28:9), presumably He then\\n     took up with Him to glory all the inhabitants of infernal paradise\\n     (including Abraham, Lazarus, and the repentant thief). We read in\\n     Ephesians 4:8 concerning Christ: \"Ascending on high, He led captivity\\n     captive; He gave gifts unto men.\" Verse 9 continues: \"But what does `He\\n     ascended\\' mean but that He also descended to the lowest parts of the\\n     earth?\" -i.e., to hades. Verse 10 adds: \"He who descended is the same\\n     as He who ascended above all the heavens.\" Presumably He led the whole\\n     band of liberated captives from hades (i.e., the whole population of\\n     preresurrection paradise) up to the glory of heaven.\\n\\nra> Whenever your personal interpretation of Biblical passages is\\nra> challenged, your only response seems to be that one needs merely to\\nra> \"look at the Bible\" in order to see the truth, but what of those who\\nra> see Biblical things differently from you?\\n\\n     I think that this characterization is faulty. Whenever my \\'personal \\n     interpretation\\' is questioned, I usually give a reason.\\n\\n     As for those that see things differently, please, put forward where\\n     there is a valid difference, and we can discuss it. \\n\\n     I seem to be seeing from you the notion that any difference in how one \\n     views the Bible is somehow legitimate, except, or course, for the stuff \\n     that I glean from it. Put forward a contrary view and perhaps we can \\n     have a discussion on that topic. But to decry something that I put \\n     forward, without putting forward something else to discuss, and to \\n     dismiss what I put forward while giving credence to other alleged views\\n     that have yet to be put forward is simply being contentious.\\n\\nra> Are we to simply assume that you are the only one who really\\nra> understands it?\\n\\n     If you believe that something that I have drawn from Scripture is \\n     wrong, then please, show me from Scripture where it is wrong.  Simply \\n     stating that there are other views is not a proof. Show it to me from \\n     Scripture and then we can go on.\\n',\n",

       "  'I\\'m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low\\napparent precision in Z-buffering, that I\\'ve encountered in 2 different\\nPEX implementations.  I can\\'t find any discussion of this problem in any\\nresources I can lay hands on (e.g. the comp.windows.x.pex FAQ, Gaskins\\'s\\n_PEXlib_Programming_Manual_, vendors\\' documentation).\\n\\nI\\'m posting this article by itself on comp.graphics, and virtually the\\nsame article with a test program demonstrating the problem on\\ncomp.windows.x.pex.  The problem is hard to describe without pictures,\\nhence this article is longish.  If you can run PEXlib 5.x programs and\\nare interested, I encourage you to build and run the test program in\\ncomp.windows.x.pex to see the effect yourself and play with my approach\\nto dealing with it.  (It depends on the utility code from the above\\nGaskins book; instructions for fetching it via anonymous FTP are given.)\\n\\nThe problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize \"stitching\"\\nartifacts resulting from the use of Z-buffering with polylines that are\\ncoplanar with filled areas.  The interpolated Z values along a line will\\ndiffer slightly, due to roundoff error, from the interpolated Z values\\nacross an area, even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with\\nvertices of the area.  Because of this, it\\'s a tossup whether the\\nZ-buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed.\\nVisually, the result tends to be a dashed-line effect even though the\\nline is supposed to be solid.\\n\\nUsing the PEXlib API, my approach to a solution is to use two slightly\\ndifferent PEX view mapping transforms, in two view table entries, one\\nfor the areas and one for the lines.  The PEX structures or immediate-\\nmode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in\\neffect for areas, and the other is always in effect for lines.  The\\nresult is a slight shift in NPC Z coordinates for the lines, so as to\\nattempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines.\\n\\nThis shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used\\nin the PEXlib view table entry for lines just a hair \"backwards\" (i.e.\\nsmaller VRC Z coordinates), compared to their positions in the view\\ntable entry used for areas.  This means that when a point is transformed\\nto NPC, its Z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than\\nif it comes from an area, thus accomplishing the desired bias.\\n\\nI would expect the Z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount\\nto a few units at most, out of the entire dynamic range of the Z-buffer,\\ntypically from 0 to 65535 if not 16777215 (i.e. 16 or 24 bit Z-buffers).\\nTherefore, it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of Z in VRC\\nbetween the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix\\nthe stitching.\\n\\nBut in fact, experience shows that the shift has to be as much as 0.003\\nto 0.006 of the range.  (Empirically, it\\'s worst when the NPC Z\\ncomponent of the slope of the surface is high, i.e. when it appears more\\nor less edge-on to the viewer.)  It\\'s as if only 8 or 9 bits of the\\nZ-buffer have any dependable meaning!  This amount is so great that one\\nproblem is replaced by another: sometimes the polylines \"show through\"\\nareas which they are supposed to lie behind.\\n\\nI\\'ve observed the problem on both Hewlett-Packard and Digital\\nworkstation PEX servers, to approximately the same degree.  The test\\nprogram demonstrates the problem on an MIT PEXlib 5.x implementation;\\nthis version is known to compile and run on an HP-UX system with PEX\\n5.1.\\n\\nOpen questions:\\n    (1) Why does this happen?\\n        --  Am I configuring the PEX view table wrongly?\\n        --  Is there a systematic difference in Z interpolation for lines\\n            as opposed to areas (e.g. pixel centers versus corners) which\\n            could be corrected for?\\n        --  Are PEX implementors wantonly discarding Z precision in their\\n            interpolators?\\n        --  Something else?\\n    (2) What to do about it?\\n        --  Can I fix my use of the view table to allow better precision\\n            in Z-buffered HLHSR?\\n        --  Is there another approach I can take to remove the stitching\\n            artifacts?\\n        --  Am I just out of luck?\\n\\nAny help would be immensely appreciated!\\n',\n",

       "  \"\\nJonathan, interesting questions.  Some wonder whether or not the moon could\\nhave ever supported an atmosphere.  I'd be interested in knowing what\\nour geology/environmental sciences friends think.\\n\\nAs for human tolerances, the best example of human endurance in terms\\nof altitude (i.e. low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure)\\nis in my opinion to the scaling of Mt. Everest without oxygen assistance.\\nThis was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high\\naltitudes for quite awhile (I think a few months) and then were flown by\\nhelicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on\\nMount Everest, where they began the ascent of our planet's highest peak\\nwithout oxygen tanks.  This is quite a feat of physiological endurance, because\\nif you or I tried to go to 20,000 feet and exert ourselves, we would probably\\npass out, get altitude sick, and could even die from cerebral edema. So\\nthis is the limit of low pressure.  High pressure situations would be\\nlimited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher\\npressure.  Skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and\\ncould tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the\\nbends.  Some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of\\npressure (not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren't in\\nfront of me).  Usually at a certain point, the nitrogen in the air becomes\\ntoxic to the body and you start acting idiotic.  Divers call this nitrogen\\nnarcosis.  Those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things, like\\ntaking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet\\nunder water.  (Hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter, as I\\nam not a diving expert).\\n\\nMars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere\\nis too thin (1/100 th  our Earth's atmospheric density).  In addition,\\nthe Mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide.  Basically, you would need a \\npressure suit there, or you'd die from the low pressure.  Interesting huh?\",\n",

JPEG is designed for compressing either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital images of \"natural\", real-world scenes.\\nIt does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line\\ndrawings.\\n\\nJPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types\\nof images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG\\nrespectively.\\n\\nJPEG is \"lossy\", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much\\nof its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably\\nthe fact that small color details aren\\'t perceived as well as small details\\nof light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will\\nbe looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the\\nsmall errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by\\nadjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small\\nfiles if you don\\'t mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image\\narchives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMaking image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across\\nnetworks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)\\n\\nIf your viewing software doesn\\'t support JPEG directly, you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using\\nJPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheaply.\\n\\nIt\\'s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the\\ntime savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompress the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet\\nposting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel\\n(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have\\nonly 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as\\nblack-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed\\nin section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among\\npeople with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably\\nmore appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,\\nGIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthings to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.\\n\\nAs a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or\\ngray-scale images of \"realistic\" scenes; that means scanned photographs and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)\\n\\nGIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,\\nsuch as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels\\nthat are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed\\nby GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these files as much as GIF does without\\nintroducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they\\nshould be avoided in JPEG files.)\\n\\nJPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels\\nadjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to\\ncome out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this\\nsort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly\\noften in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is\\nparticularly objectionable with text that\\'s only a few pixels high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between\\nscanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.\\nYou need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale\\nimages.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images\\nof up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.\\n\\nIf you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only\\napplies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify\\nconverting anyway.  This is a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be\\nprepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?\\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfiles are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in bytes\\t\\tComments\\n\\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits\\n\\t\\t\\t or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress\\n\\t\\t\\t compress doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.\\nship.gif\\t 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the savings is the result of losing color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.\\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)\\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this\\n\\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t This has slight defects; if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\'s been JPEGed without seeing\\n\\t\\t\\t the original.  Still as good image quality as many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.\\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\'s characteristic \"blockiness\" becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet postings that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than this.\\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !\\n\\nIn this case JPEG can make a file that\\'s a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scenes.\\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" settings for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by\\nselecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about\\nthe meaning of these settings.  \"Quality 95\" does NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;\\nit\\'s not a percentage of anything.\\n\\nThe name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting\\n(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rules of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This\\nsetting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to\\n95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are\\nprepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is\\nabout right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG\\nsoftware described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different\\nquality scale.  Some programs don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choices.)\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find sources\".\\n(If you don\\'t have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the\\nsame article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can\\nget it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with\\n\"send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources\" in the body.  The \"Anonymous FTP\\nList FAQ\" may also be helpful --- it\\'s usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in\\nthe news.answers archive.\\n\\nNOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple\\nmonths old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.\\n\\n\\n[6A]  If you are looking for \"canned\" software, viewers, etc:\\n\\nThe first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one\\nkind of system.  If you don\\'t see what you want for your machine, check out\\nthe portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this\\nlist concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over\\nInternet; but some commercial programs are listed too.\\n\\nX Windows:\\n\\nXV (shareware, $25) is an excellent viewer for JPEG, GIF, and many other\\nimage formats.  It can also do format conversion and some simple image\\nmanipulations.  It\\'s available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12),\\nfile contrib/xv-3.00.tar.Z.  Version 3.00 is a major upgrade with support\\nfor 24-bit displays and many other improvements; however, it is brand new\\nand still has some bugs lurking.  If you prefer not to be on the bleeding\\nedge, stick with version 2.21, also available from export.  Note that\\nversion 2.21 is not a good choice if you have a 24-bit display (you\\'ll get\\nonly 8-bit color), nor for converting 24-bit images to JPEG.  But 2.21 works\\nfine for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.  CAUTION: there is a\\nglitch in version 2.21: be sure to check the \"save at normal size\" checkbox\\nwhen saving a JPEG file, or the file will be blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Windows is John Cristy\\'s free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThis package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The\\nImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped\\ndisplays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage-3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said\\nto do the right thing with 24-bit displays.\\n\\n\\nMS-DOS:\\n\\nThis covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.\\n\\nOne good choice is Eric Praetzel\\'s free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.\\nThe current version, 2.5, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg25.zip.  This is a good basic\\nviewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is\\nnot flashy, but it\\'s functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei\\'s Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and\\nOS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).\\nYou may or may not prefer this approach, but there\\'s no denying that it\\nslows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a\\nbit tricky; read the directions carefully!\\n\\nA shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is\\nalso much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.\\nRequires a VESA graphics driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains\\nthat the driver is missing.)\\n\\nA second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.\\nThe author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly\\nand it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\'s JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\'s slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is\\npoor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these\\nviewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll need to use one of the following conversion programs\\nto convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF as the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right\\nthing with hi-color displays.)\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\'s free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS\\ncompilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.\\n\\nHandmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI\\'s proprietary\\nJPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format\\nfiles are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version\\n2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from\\nSimtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.\\nNOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is\\nnot readable on non-PC platforms.\\n\\nHandmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation\\npackage, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI\\nformats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.\\nA demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.2 is available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch162.zip.\\n\\nNOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet\\'s key archive site for PC-related programs\\nis Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20\\nruns a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document\\nrefers to directory (eg) \"msdos/graphics\" at Simtel20, that really means\\n\"pd1:<msdos.graphics>\".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should\\nexpect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several\\nInternet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;\\nmost FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA\\nmirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files\\nin (eg) \"/pub/msdos/graphics\".  If you have no FTP capability, you can\\nretrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in\\ncomp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,\\nconsult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.\\n\\nMicrosoft Windows:\\n\\nThere are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.\\n(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,\\ndue to Windows\\' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion\\nprograms described above inside a Windows DOS window.)\\n\\nThe newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0\\nis available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.\\nRequires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills\\nviewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it\\ndecodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.\\nBut it\\'s so fast you\\'ll use it anyway, at least for previewing...\\n\\nJView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the\\ndecompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can\\'t create new JPEG\\nfiles, and it doesn\\'t view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful\\nfeatures of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it\\'s\\nan excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from\\nftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.\\n(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,\\nincluding wuarchive.wustl.edu.)\\n\\nWinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;\\nit can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.\\nIt has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and\\nslideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror\\nsites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow\\n286-compatible version; if you register, you\\'ll get the 386-only version,\\nwhich is roughly 25% faster.)\\n\\nColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising\\ncontender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it\\nhas no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the\\ncurrent version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file\\npub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will\\nbe appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)\\n\\nDVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen\\nmode, not in a window.\\n\\nOS/2:\\n\\nThe following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).\\nNote: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator\\nis not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip\\n    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.\\n/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip\\n    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc12.zip\\n    Image Archiver 1.02: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.\\n    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip\\n    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows\\n    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.\\n/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview85.zip\\n    PMView 0.85: JPEG/GIF/BMP/Targa/PCX viewer.  GIF viewing very fast,\\n    JPEG viewing roughly the same speed as the above two programs.  Has\\n    image manipulation & slideshow functions.  Shareware, $20.\\n\\nMacintosh:\\n\\nMost Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple\\'s JPEG implementation, which is part of\\nthe QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.\\nTo use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running\\nSystem 6.0.7 or later.  (If you\\'re running System 6, you must also install\\nthe 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get\\nQuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.\\n(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0\\nin several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and\\nconsiderably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,\\nsome applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)\\n\\nMac users should keep in mind that QuickTime\\'s JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is\\nnot the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for\\ndetails.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.\\nMost of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.\\n\\nThe first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images\\nthat are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can\\nconvert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big\\nimprovement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu\\n(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and\\nQuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color\\nimage quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can\\nview large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it\\'s\\nthe only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a\\ntypical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down\\nto fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other\\nviewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people\\nlike this behavior, some don\\'t.  Overall, JPEGView\\'s user interface is very\\nwell thought out.\\n\\nGIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and\\nPICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest\\nversion is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.\\nGIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but\\nit has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion\\ncapabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of\\nplaying around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can\\nload and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if\\nyour machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it\\'s faster with QuickTime.)\\nNote: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try\\nconverting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.\\n\\nJPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is\\navailable from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.\\nThis will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.\\nYou can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.\\n\\nPrevious versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF\\nconverter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this\\nprogram, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.\\n\\nApple\\'s free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and\\nGIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie\\nfrom ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.\\nRequires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer\\'s tool, and it\\'s\\nreally not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.\\nSome of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces\\nrelatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,\\nand it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an\\nunsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not\\nintend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called\\nPICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash\\nit, as it\\'s even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much\\ncleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that\\nPicture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)\\n\\nStorm Technology\\'s Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.\\nThis rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but\\nit will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on\\nolder systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can\\'t\\nuse it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file\\n/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a\\ndownloaded image file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.\\n\\nIf your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),\\nGIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you\\ndon\\'t want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.\\n\\nMore and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not\\nall can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version\\n2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG\\nplug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded\\nJPEG file to \\'JPEG\\' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.\\n\\nAmiga:\\n\\n(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this\\narchive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good\\nchoice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)\\n\\nHamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a\\ngeneral image manipulation tool.  It\\'s cheap (shareware, $20) and can read\\nseveral formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version\\nis available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger\\nthan 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.\\n\\nRend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,\\nand GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even\\ncapturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The\\ncurrent version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror\\nsites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is\\nsupposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under\\nAmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)\\n\\nViewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,\\navailable from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file\\namiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.\\n\\nIf you\\'re willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages\\nthat support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24\\nand Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and\\nImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,\\neffects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are\\ndistributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),\\nfrom ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation\\nsoftware for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another\\nwell-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from\\namiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file\\nAmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.\\n\\nThe Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many\\nbased on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks\\nto a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without\\nso much as notifying the authors).  Among these are \"AugJPEG\", \"NewAmyJPEG\",\\n\"VJPEG\", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,\\nanything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space\\nit\\'s stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.\\n\\nAtari ST:\\n\\nThe free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.\\nThese programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.\\n\\nFor monochrome ST monitors, try MGIF, which manages to achieve four-level\\ngrayscale effect by flickering.  Version 4.1 reads JPEG files.  Available\\nfrom atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/mgif41b.zoo.\\n\\nI have not heard of any other free or shareware JPEG-capable viewers for\\nAtaris, but surely there must be some by now?  Pointers appreciated.\\n\\nAcorn Archimedes:\\n\\n!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view\\nJPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,\\nalthough this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.\\n\\nRecent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle\\nJPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolors.  This process is called \"color quantization\".  (This is something\\nof a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most\\nimages, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality settings).\\n\\nSince JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for\\n*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncomes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.\\nThis happens because JPEG\\'s lossiness affects each pixel a little\\ndifferently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably\\ncome out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets \"smeared\"\\ninto a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image\\nsource.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidentally, because of this effect it\\'s nearly meaningless to talk about\\nthe number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you\\ndifferent results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see\\nposted images described as \"256-color JPEG\".  This tells me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but\\nnumber of colors just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to\\n256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its\\npalette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entries.)\\nFor purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the\\nsender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don\\'t have to.\\nThis is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\'s\\nquantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality\\nfor all users whose machines don\\'t match the sender\\'s display hardware.\\nJPEG\\'s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user\\'s display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in\\nthis area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimages you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what was\\nsent.\\n\\nIt\\'s also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather\\nshoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you\\nneed to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color\\nquantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\'s\\nalso due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use\\nhigh quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be\\ndisplayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!\\n\\nFinally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on\\nworkstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already\\nobsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.\\nThus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images\\nin a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How does JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine\\ntransforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncoding.  This article\\'s long enough already, so I\\'m not going to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThis is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files\\n/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in\\nusing the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossless JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\'s a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the\\nfinal output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this\\nlossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSaying \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.\\nWhat it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the\\ncolor subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in\\nvarious calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\'s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.\\n\\nAt this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps\\nhalf the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG\\nprovides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees\\nbit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less\\nthan 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG\\nlossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with\\n6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.\\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?\\n\\nStrictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;\\nit does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was\\nprevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international\\nstandards organizations.\\n\\nSince we can\\'t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on\\na common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to\\n\"do their own thing\", and as a result their programs aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\'s.\\n\\nThe closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work\\nthat\\'s been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined\\ntwo JPEG-based file formats:\\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transports\\n    pixels and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is\\n    a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everything you\\n    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is\\n    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,\\n    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different\\n    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It\\'s not likely that adding JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anything to improve this situation.\\nBoth of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors\\nof JPEG-related products; it\\'s reasonably likely that future commercial\\nproducts will adhere to one or both standards.\\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in\\npicture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still\\nunusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well\\ndefined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interested in is Apple\\'s QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped\\ninside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for details.\\n\\nAnother particular case is Handmade Software\\'s programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by\\nHSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be\\nused for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This\\napplies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfiles, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\'s likely\\nto be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\'s worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI files start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unless you have HSI\\n    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompress properly with non-HSI programs.\\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred\\n    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anything else: it\\'s a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripping off everything before that.\\n\\nIn uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwhereas uuencoded HSI files will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownloading non-JFIF files.\\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic coding?\\n\\nThe JPEG spec defines two different \"back end\" modules for the final output\\nof compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.\\nThe choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually\\nproduces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding\\nproduces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the\\nfile-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)\\n\\nUnfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the\\nJPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses\\nfrom these companies.  (The \"fair use\" doctrine allows people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious\\nat best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic coding; the space savings isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*\\nbe used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.\\n\\nThere is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tuned for further details.\\n\\n\\n[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.\\nUnfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered\\nimage loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress\\nit *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\'s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually\\ndegrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)\\nOne of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that\\ncompressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes\\nas cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wondering why, it\\'s because the pixel-block boundaries move.\\nIf you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but\\nthat\\'s a mighty limited capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of images, but you don\\'t want to use it as an intermediate\\nformat for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time this way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?\\n\\nAs stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF was made from, it\\'s far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum\\nloss of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsetting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors\\ndon\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best\\ncandidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created\\ndirectly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through\\nJPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).\\n\\nMany people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of\\nstorage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifacts (\"ghost\" edges).  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows\\nsystem, XV\\'s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless\\nway to do this.)\\n\\ncjpeg\\'s default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher\\nQ setting may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually \"dithered\" to fool\\nyour eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of\\nsignificantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels\\ntogether to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG\\nfile is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around this, you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid\\ncolor changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will\\noften let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of\\nthe compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smoothing.\\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing\\ncapability is built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when converting GIFs.\\nValues of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed\\ndithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image processing\\nwizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as\\npnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg\\'s built-in smoother is\\na LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all this is that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" is probably a\\ngood starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.\\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n',\n",

Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be\\nassisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.\\n\\nMARGARET ATWOOD\\n\\n\"The Handmaid\\'s Tale\"\\nA story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously\\nassassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it\\n\"right\" again.  The book is the diary of a woman\\'s life as she tries to live\\nunder the new Christian theocracy.  Women\\'s right to own property is revoked,\\nand their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the\\nradio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished\\nretroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the \"old world\" are\\nhunted down and hanged.  Atwood\\'s writing style is difficult to get used to\\nat first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.\\n\\nVARIOUS AUTHORS\\n\\n\"The Bible\"\\nThis somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.

In this\\nwork, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the\\nexistence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely\\nupon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and\\naesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were\\ndecisively rejected in Mackie\\'s \"The Miracle of Theism\".

It ranges from the classical\\nphilosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through\\nthe moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements\\nof the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those\\npositions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational,\\nsuch as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as \"replacements for\\nGod\" such as Lelie\\'s axiarchism.

Properly \\n          designed Free Energy Devices do NOT have such limitations. \\n          \\n               For example, at least three U.S. patents (#3,811,058, \\n          #3,879,622, and #4,151,431) have so far been awarded for \\n          motors that run EXCLUSIVELY on permanent MAGNETS, seemingly \\n          tapping into energy circulating through the earth\\'s magnetic \\n          field.  The first two require a feedback network in order to \\n          be self-running.  The third one, as described in detail in \\n          \"Science & Mechanics\" magazine, Spring 1980, (\"Amazing \\n          Magnet-Powered Motor\", by Jorma Hyypia, pages 45-48, 114-117, \\n          and front cover), requires critical sizes, shapes, \\n          orientations, and spacings of magnets, but NO feedback.  Such \\n          a motor could drive an electric generator or reversible \\n          heatpump in one\\'s home, YEAR ROUND, FOR FREE.

They typically have a \\'SPARK GAP\\' in the circuit \\n          which serves to SYNCHRONIZE the energy in the coils with the \\n          energy being tapped.  It is important that the total \\n          \\'inductance\\' and \\'capacitance\\' of the Device combine to \\n          \\'RESONATE\\' at the same frequency as \\'EARTH RESONANCE\\' in \\n          order to maximize the power output.  This output can also be \\n          increased by centering the SPARK GAP at the \\'NEUTRAL CENTER\\' \\n          of a strong U-shaped permanent magnet.  In the case of a \\n          Tesla Coil, slipping a \\'TOROID CHOKE COIL\\' around the \\n          secondary coil will enhance output power.  [\"Earth Energy: \\n          Fuelless Propulsion & Power Systems\", by John Bigelow, 1976, \\n          Health Research, P.O. Box 70, Mokelumne Hill, CA  95245.] \\n          \\n               During the 1930\\'s, an Austrian civil engineer named \\n          Viktor Schauberger invented and partially developed an \\n          \\'IMPLOSION TURBINE\\' (German name, \\'ZOKWENDLE\\'), after \\n          analyzing erosion, and lack of erosion, in differently shaped \\n          waterways, and developing sophisticated mathematical \\n          equations to explain it.  As described in the book \"A \\n          Breakthrough to New Free-Energy Sources\", by Dan A. Davidson, \\n          1977, water is pumped by an IMPELLER pump through a \\n          LOGARITHMIC-SPIRAL-shaped coil of tubing until it reaches a \\n          CRITICAL VELOCITY.  The water then IMPLODES, no longer \\n          touching the inside walls of the tubing, and drives the pump, \\n          which then converts the pump\\'s motor into an ELECTRIC \\n          GENERATOR.  The device seems to be tapping energy from that \\n          of the earth\\'s rotation, via the \\'Coriolis effect\\', LIKE A \\n          TORNADO.  [ It can also NEUTRALIZE GRAVITY! ] \\n          \\n               A fourth type of Free Energy Device is the \\'McClintock \\n          Air Motor\\' (U.S. Patent #2,982,261), which is a cross between \\n          a diesel engine (it has three cylinders with a compression \\n          ratio of 27 to 1) and a rotary engine (with solar and \\n          planetary gears).  It burns NO FUEL, but becomes self-running \\n          by driving its own air compressor.  This engine also \\n          generates a lot of heat, which could be used to heat \\n          buildings; and its very HIGH TORQUE makes it ideal for large \\n          trucks, preventing their slowing down when climbing hills.  \\n          [David McClintock is also the REAL original Inventor of the \\n          automatic transmission, differential, and 4-wheel drive.] \\n          \\n               Crystals may someday be used to supply energy, as shown \\n          in the Star Trek shows, perhaps by inserting each one between \\n          metal capacitor plates and bombarding it with a beam of \\n          particles from a small radioactive source like that used in a \\n          common household smoke detector. \\n          \\n               One other energy source should be mentioned here, \\n          despite the fact that it does not fit the definition of Free \\n          Energy.  A Bulgarian-born American Physicist named Joseph \\n          Maglich has invented and partially developed an atomic FUSION \\n          reactor which he calls \\'Migma\\', which uses NON-radioactive \\n          deuterium as a fuel [available in nearly UNLIMITED quantities \\n          from sea water], does NOT produce radioactive waste, can be \\n          converted DIRECTLY into electricity (with-OUT energy-wasting \\n          steam turbines), and can be constructed small enough to power \\n          a house or large enough to power a city.  And UNLIKE the \\n          \"Tokamaks\" and laser fusion MONSTROSITIES that we read about, \\n          Migma WORKS, already producing at least three watts of power \\n          for every watt put in.  [\"New Times\" (U.S. version), 6-26-78, \\n          pages 32-40.] \\n          \\n               And then there are the \\'cold fusion\\' experiments that \\n          have been in the news lately, originally conducted by \\n          University of Utah researchers B. Stanley Pons and Martin \\n          Fleischmann.  Some U.S. Navy researchers at the China Lake \\n          Naval Weapons Center in California, under the direction of \\n          chemist Melvin Miles, finally took the trouble to collect the \\n          bubbles coming from such an apparatus, had them analyzed with \\n          mass-spectrometry techniques, and found HELIUM 4, which \\n          PROVES that atomic FUSION did indeed take place, and enough \\n          of it to explain the excess heat generated. \\n          \\n               There are GOOD INDICATIONS that the two so-called \"laws\" \\n          of thermodynamics are NOT so \"absolute\".  For example, the \\n          late Physicist Dewey B. Larson developed a comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he \\n          calls the \\'Reciprocal System\\', (which he describes in detail \\n          in several books such as \"Nothing But Motion\" (1979) and \"The \\n          Universe of Motion\" (1984)), in which the physical universe \\n          has TWO DISTINCT HALVES, the material half and an anti-matter \\n          half, with a CONTINUOUS CYCLE of matter and energy passing \\n          between them, with-OUT the \"heat death\" predicted by \\n          thermodynamic \"laws\".  His Theory explains the universe MUCH \\n          BETTER than modern orthodox theories, including phenomena \\n          that orthodox physicists and astronomers are still scratching \\n          their heads about, and is SELF-CONSISTENT in every way.  Some \\n          Free Energy Devices might be tapping into that energy flow, \\n          seemingly converting \"low-quality energy\" into \"high-quality \\n          energy\". \\n          \\n               Also, certain religious organizations such as \\'Sant Mat\\' \\n          and \\'Eckankar\\' teach their Members that the physical universe \\n          is only the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN major levels of \\n          existence, like parallel universes, or analogous to TV \\n          channels, as described in books like \"The Path of the \\n          Masters\", by Dr. Julian Johnson, 1939, and \"Eckankar: The Key \\n          to Secret Worlds\", by Sri Paul Twitchell, 1969.  For example, \\n          the next level up from the physical universe is commonly \\n          called the \\'Astral Plane\\'.  Long-time Members of these groups \\n          have learned to \\'Soul Travel\\' into these higher worlds and \\n          report on conditions there.  It seems plausible that energy \\n          could flow down from these higher levels into the physical \\n          universe, or be created at the boundary between them, given \\n          the right configuration of matter to channel it.  This is \\n          supported by many successful laboratory-controlled \\n          experiments in PSYCHO-KINESIS throughout the world, such as \\n          those described in the book \"Psychic Discoveries Behind the \\n          Iron Curtain\". \\n          \\n               In terms of economics, the market has FAILED.  Inventors \\n          do not have enough money and other resources to fully develop \\n          and mass-produce Free Energy Equipment, and the conventional \\n          energy producer$ have no desire to do so because of their \\n          VE$TED INTERE$T$.  The government is needed to intervene.  If \\n          the government does not intervene, then the total supply of \\n          energy resources from the earth will continue to decline and \\n          will soon run out, prices for energy will increase, and \\n          pollution and its harmful effects (including the \\'GREENHOUSE \\n          EFFECT\\', acid rain, smog, radioactive contamination, oil \\n          spills, rape of the land by strip mining, etc.) will continue \\n          to increase. \\n          \\n               The government should SUBSIDIZE research and development \\n          of Free Energy by Inventors and universities, subsidize \\n          private production (until the producers can make it on their \\n          own), and subsidize consumption by low-income consumers of \\n          Free Energy Hardware. \\n          \\n               The long-range effects of such government intervention \\n          would be wide-spread and profound.  The quantity of energy \\n          demanded from conventional energy producer$ (coal mining \\n          companie$, oil companie$ and countries, electric utilitie$, \\n          etc.) would drop to near zero, forcing their employees to \\n          seek work elsewhere.  Energy resources (coal, uranium, oil, \\n          and gas) would be left in the ground.  Prices for \\n          conventional energy supplies would also drop to near zero, \\n          while the price of Free Energy Equipment would start out high \\n          but drop as supply increases (as happened with VCR\\'s, \\n          personal computers, etc.).  Costs of producing products that \\n          require large quantities of energy to produce would decrease, \\n          along with their prices to consumers.  Consumers would be \\n          able to realize the \"opportunity costs\" of paying electric \\n          utility bills or buying home heating fuel.  Tourism would \\n          benefit and increase because travelers would not have to \\n          spend their money for gasoline for their cars.  Government \\n          tax revenue from gasoline and other fuels would have to be \\n          obtained in some other way.  AND ENERGY COULD NO LONGER BE \\n          USED AS A MOTIVE OR EXCUSE FOR MAKING WAR. \\n          \\n               Many conventional energy producer$ would go out of \\n          business, but society as a whole, and the earth\\'s environment \\n          and ecosystems, would benefit greatly.

Take a good radio or TV with you so that you can stay \\nattuned to events and discern the time schedule of the Tribulation.\\n[\"As you can see on the weather map, heavy currents of Tribulation will sweep\\ninto our area by daybreak.

WATCH FOR THE ANTICHRIST\\n\\n\\tIt is important to realize who the Antichrist is and what he is up to,\\nfor he will deceive many into thinking that he is a great world leader who will\\nbring peace and prosperity to a world hungry for it.  We can infer from Daniel \\n11 certain characteristics of this man.  Popular during the first three and a\\nhalf years of the Tribulation, he will dominate the airwaves.  He will be \\nphysically appealing, highly intelligent, with Christ-like charisma and \\npersonality.  An international politician, military tactician and economic\\nexpert, his word will be peace; he will make a treaty with the Jews, which\\nhe will break after three and a half years.  He will have such supernatural \\npower that a mortal wound to his head will be healed.  Even the very elect will\\nbe deceived.  If you do not pray and read the Bible, you too will be deceived.\\n[Dominate the airwaves?  Perhaps Howard Stern or Rush Limbaugh...-M]\\n\\tThe antichrist will have a companion, the False Prohphet [sic], who\\nwill make an image in the likeness of the Antichrist and cause it to speak.  \\nAll who refuse to worhsip [sic] the image will be killed.  The final three and\\na half years will be absolutely insane, with demonized spirits everywhere.\\n\\nX. DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE!\\n\\n\\tThe seven years of Tribulation will end with the triumphant return of\\nChrist.  The Antichrist will be defeated.  Be steadfast and endure, and you \\nwill be rewarded greatly in Heaven.  \\n\\tStart reading the Bible and praying fervently now.  The salvation of \\nyour sould depends upon it.  Determine that, come what may, you will not take\\nthe mark or worship the Antichrist.

       "  'Brian Ceccarelli presents us with the fallacy of False Dichotomy in stating\\nthat we must accept every thing in the books attributed to Peter, or we must\\ndiscount every other book of antiquity:\\n\\n\\nMr Ceccarelli, you seem to be stating that we must accept accept everything\\nwritten in every \"historical\" document.  Somehow I doubt do that yourself\\nthat.  Thus since I doubt you accept everything written in every historical\\ndocument, I would ask how you can thereby objectively justify complete faith\\nin the words of the books attributed to Peter. \\n\\nI shall now give an example of a document from antiquity, which I am sure you\\nreject; it dates from the time of Ramses II (This was first presented here by\\nMatthew Wiener).  These inscriptions were carved soon after a battle, and were\\ncarved with the Pharoah\\'s specific approval so we have true originals, rather\\nthan mere copies.  This account records the the battle of Kadesh (circa 1285\\nBC), which occurred on the river Orontes, (about 100 miles south of Aleppo). \\nThe Egyptians won this battle with the Hittites, and Ramses had his victory\\ninscribed all over the place.  A few of of these inscriptions have survived in\\nnear perfect form.  It is a record of how the Pharoah pretty much\\nsingle-handedly defeated the Hittites, after being separated from his troops. \\n\\nNote that the Egyptian wavers back and forth between first and third person. \\nThe following is from Miriam Lichtheim`s _Ancient Egyptian Literature_ volume\\nII.\\n\\n\\tMy majesty caused the forces of the foes from Hitti to fall\\n\\ton their faces, one upon the other, as crocodiles fall, into\\n\\tthe water of the Orontes.  I was after them like a griffin;\\n\\tI attacked all the countries, I alone.  For my infantry and\\n\\tmy chariotry had deserted me; not one of them stood looking\\n\\tback.  As I live, as Ra loves me, as my father Atum favors\\n\\tme, everything that my majesty has told I did it in truth,\\n\\tin the presence of my infantry and my chariotry.\\n\\n(Note: This paragraph records not only Ramses \"divine word,\" but also that\\nthere were thousands of witnesses to the event.  Now from the heart of \\nbattle.)\\n\\n\\tThen his majesty drove at a gallop and charged the forces\\n\\tof the Foe from Hitti, being alone by himself, none other\\n\\twith him.  His majesty proceeded to look about him and\\n\\tfound 2500 chariots ringing him on his way out ...\\n\\n\\tNo officer was with me, no charioteer,\\n\\tNo soldier of the army, no shield-bearer;\\n\\tMy infantry, my chariotry yielded before them,\\n\\tNot one of them stood firm to fight with them.\\n\\tHis majesty spoke: \"What is this, father Amun?\\n\\tIs it right for a father to ignore his son?\\n\\tAre my deeds a matter for you to ignore?\\n\\tDo I not walk and stand at your word?\\n\\tI have not neglected an order you gave.\\n\\tToo great is he, the great lord of Egypt,\\n\\tTo allow aliens to step on his path!\\n\\tWhat are these Asiatics to you, O Amun,\\n\\tThe wretches ignorant of god?\\n\\tHave I not made for you many great monuments,\\n\\t...\\n\\tI call to you, my father Amun,\\n\\tI am among a host of strangers;\\n\\tAll countries are arrayed against me,\\n\\tI am alone, there\\'s none with me!\\n\\t...\\n\\tThe labors of many people are nothing,\\n\\tAmun is more helpful than they;\\n\\tI came here by the command of your mouth,\\n\\tO Amun, I have not transgressed your command!\"\\n\\n\\tNow though I prayed in a distant land,\\n\\tMy voice resounded in Southern Thebes.\\n\\tI found Amun came when I called to him,\\n\\tHe gave me his hand and I rejoiced.\\n\\tHe called from behind as if near by:\\n\\t\"Forward, I am with you,\\n\\tI your father, my hand is with you,\\n\\tI prevail over a hundred thousand men,\\n\\tI am lord of victory, lover of valor!\"\\n\\tI found my heart stout, my breast in joy,\\n\\tAll I did succeeded, I was like Mont.\\n\\t...\\n\\tI slaughtered among them at my will,\\n\\tNot one looked behind him,\\n\\tNot one turned around,\\n\\tWhoever fell down did not rise.\\n\\t...\\n\\tOne called out to the other saying:\\n\\t\"No man is he who is among us,\\n\\tIt is Seth great-of-strength, Baal in person;\\n\\tNot deeds of man are these his doings,\\n\\tThey are of one who is unique,\\n\\tWho fights a hundred thousand without soldiers and chariots,\\n\\tCome quick, flee before him,\\n\\tTo seek life and breathe air;\\n\\tFor he who attempts to get close to him,\\n\\tHis hands, all his limbs grow limp.\\n\\tOne cannot hold either bow or spears,\\n\\tWhen one sees him come racing along!\"\\n\\tMy majesty hunted them like a griffin,\\n\\tI slaughtered among them unceasingly.\\n\\nSo you see Brian, we have a few original manuscripts recording the miraculous \\nbattle between the Ramses and the Hittites.  Do you reject them as being\\n*completely* true? I suspect you do, and if so, then do you also, in your own\\nwords: \\n\\n    \"question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\\n     Nero, Caligula, Josephus, Cyrus the Great, Artexerxes?\"\\n\\nDo you also thereby question all their documents? That`s the problem with your\\n\"all or nothing\" approach.  Many ancient people used to mix a bit of fancy\\nwith their facts.  So for you to say that we must either accept all of Peter\\n(and the rest of the New Testament) or accept no records of antiquity at all,\\nforces you thereby, to accept the verity of documents you probably do not find\\ncompletely credible. \\n\\nAs to your other argument that so many people have testified to Jesus, that he\\nmust be true:\\n\\n \\nI have three points.  \\n\\nFirst, this is \"argumentum ad populum\" (ie: appeal to popular opinion); you\\ncannot vote on truth.  For instance, do the millions of Hindu\\'s past and\\npresent who testify to the reality of Brahma, constitute actual evidence for\\nthe existence of Brahma? How would you answer your own question in regards to\\nthe testimony of Hindus:\\n\\n\\t\"With a scoff of your keyboard, with near complete ignorance of \\n\\t the testimonies, are you going to say that that is all complete \\n\\t hooey?\"\\n\\nIf you do so \"scoff,\" then how do you objectively justify your own special\\npleading?\\n\\nSecond, it is not at all clear that King Solomon or King David testified to\\nJesus.  You can claim it to be clear, but that does not make it true. \\n\\nThird, it is quite arguable that Abraham Lincoln was not Christian, and that\\nhe had both a public and a private view of Christianity.  In fact there was\\nmuch discussion about it in his day (yes, he was publically accused of being a\\ndeist.  Oh my).

       "  '\\n\\nThis definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into\\nthe support of science; some of it is relevant in technology.  There\\nwas little involvement of federal funds, or except through support of\\nstate universities, of state funds, for scientific research before WWII.\\nThe US research position had been growing steadily, and the funding was\\nmainly from university and private foundation funds.  There were not that\\nmany research universities, but they all provided their researchers with\\nlow teaching loads, laboratories, assistants, and equipment, and funds for\\ntravel to scientific meetings.  Not that much, but it was provided, and a\\nuniversity wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well\\nas salary.\\n\\nDuring WWII, the military and the defense departments found that pure\\nscientists could do quite well with their problems, even though they \\nwere not exactly in the areas of the scientists\\' expertise.  This is\\nprobably because of the \"research mind\" approach, which is not to try\\nto find a solution, but to understand the problem and see if a solution\\nemerges.  This works in stages, and as research scientists were used to\\ndiscussion about their problems, the job got done.\\n\\nThe military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the\\nfuture, and started funding pure research after WWII.  But Congress was\\nunwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the\\nfuture supply of scientists, and set up other organizations, such as \\nNSF, to do the job.  It also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly\\nkeep politics out.  Also, the government did a job on private foundations,\\nmaking it more difficult for them to act to support research.\\n\\nThe worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which\\nthe government supports research the university will not provide funding,\\nand in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money.  Suppose,\\nas has been the case, I have a project which could use the assistance of\\na graduate student for a few months.  What do you think happens if I ask\\nfor one?  The answer I will get is, \"Get the money from NSF.\"  Now the\\nmoney at the university level is a few thousand, but at the NSF level it\\ncomes to about 20 thousand, and is likely to keep a faculty member from\\ngetting supported.  So the government is, in effect, deciding which projects\\nget supported, and how much.  \\n\\nAlso, the government decided that the \"wealth\" should be spread.  So instead\\nof having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research\\ninstitutions, the idea that more schools should get into the act came into\\nbeing.  And instead of evaluating scholars, they had to go to evaluating\\nreseach proposals.  As a researcher, I can tell you that any research proposal\\nhas to be mainly wishful thinking, or as now happens, the investigator conceals\\nalready done work to release it as the results of the research.  What I am\\nproposing today I may solve before the funding is granted, I may find \\nimpossible, or I may find that it is too difficult.

Clarke\\n\\nKrieger Publishing Company\\nMelbourne, Florida, USA\\nOrig. Ed. 1993\\nPre-publication $84.50\\nISBN 0-89464-039-9\\n\\n\\nThis text is a history of the spaceship as both a cultural and a\\ntechnological phenomenon.  The idea of a vehicle for traversing the\\nspace betwen worlds did not spring full-blown into existence in the\\ntlatter half of theis century.  The need preceded the ability ot make\\nsuch a device by several hundred years.  As soon as it was realized\\nthat there were other worlds than this one, human beings wanted to\\nreach them.   \\n\\nTracing the history of the many imaginative, and often prescient,\\nattempts to solve this problem also reflects the history of\\ntechnology, science, astronomy, and engineering.  Once space travel\\nbecame feasible, there were many more spacecraft concepts developed\\nthan ever got off the drawing board-- or off the ground, for that\\nmatter.  These also are described in theis book, for the same reason\\nas the pre-space-age and pre-flight ideas are:  they are all accurate\\nreflections of their particular era's dreams, abilities, and\\nknowledge.  Virtually every spaceship concept invented since 1500, as\\nwell as selected events important in developing the idea of\\nextraterrestrial travel, is listed chronologically.  The chronological\\nentries allow comparisons between actual astronautical events and\\nspeculative ventures.  They also allow comparisons between\\nsimultaneous events taking place in different countries.  They reveal\\nconnections, influences, and evolutions hitherto unsuspected.  Every\\nentry is accompanied by at least one illustration.  Nearly every\\nspacecraft concept is illustrated with a schematic drawing.  This\\nallows accurate comparisons to be made between designss, to visualize\\ndifferences, similarities, and influences.\\n\\nThis text will be of interest to students of astronautical history,\\nand also to model builders who would be interested in the schematic\\ndiagrams.   Science fiction fans as well as aviation history buffs and\\nhistorians of science will also find this book to be fascinating.  The\\nunique collection of illustrations makes it a visually attractive and\\nvery interesting history of the spaceship.\\n\\nSPECIAL FEATURES\\n\\nIncludes scale drawings of several hundred spacecraft, both real and\\nfictional\\n\\nContains scores of illustrations: artwork, drawings, and photos\\ncontemporary with the subject.

       "  '930425\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s start with the name \"Rosicrucian\". I took me a long time to come\\nto the conclusion that there is a difference between a *member* of a\\n\"rosicrucian\" body and BEING *a* ROSICRUCIAN. So when you say that you met\\nsome \\'rosicrucians\\' you mean \"members of a group that calls themselves\\nrosicrucian\". At least that is what your observation suggests :-)\\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis makes much sense to me.  This is also true of most religions.\\nThere is a difference between being a *member* of a group of people\\nwho call themselves \\'Hindus\\' or \\'Christians\\' or \\'Pagans\\' and actually\\n*BEING* any of these.  The social groups tend to make very important\\nrequirements about not belonging to other \\'religions\\'.  I find that\\nthe ideal described by the holy texts of most religions can be\\ninterpreted in very similar ways so that one could presume that\\n\\'mysticism\\' is the core of every religion and Huxley\\'s \\'Perennial\\nPhilosophy\\' is the Great Secret Core of all mystical trads. :>\\n\\n\\nTony:\\n\\nI\\'d prefer if you would have stated up front that it was the Lectorium\\nRosicrucianum, only because they may be confused, by some readers of this\\nnewsgroup, with the Rosicrucian Order AMORC based (the USA Jurisdiction) in\\nSan Jose, CA; this being the RC org with the most members (last time I\\nlooked). Of course, \"most members\" does not *necessarily* mean \"best\".\\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nCertainly true.  I didn\\'t know there WERE any groups which called themselves\\n\\'Rosicrucians\\' that didn\\'t associate with AMORC.  Sure, I\\'ve heard all the\\nhubbub about the Golden Dawn and Rosae Crucis in relation to all these\\nWestern esoteric groups, but hadn\\'t heard about other \\'Rosicrucians\\'.\\nI\\'ll admit my bias.  I live in San Jose. :>\\n\\n\\nTony:\\n\\n\"You\\'ll have to trust me\" when I tell you that if that\\nlecture/class/whatever had been presented by AMORC, it is unlikely that you\\nwould have had the same impression, i.e., you\\'d probably have had a\\npositive impression more likely than a negative one, IMHO. \\n\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThis may be slightly off.  I\\'ve met some of these Rosicrucians and have\\na couple friends in AMORC.  The stories I\\'ve heard and the slight contact\\nI\\'ve had with them does not give me the hope that I\\'d be received with\\nany kind of warm welcome.

The problems you present are exist anyway,\\nand I didn't tried to solve them at all, because I would not make such\\nproblems to my programs in the first place.\\n\\nGamma and color corrections are easily done to 24bit image\\nas I presented. There's no need make tricks from 8bit/quantized image\\nback to 24 bit image.\\n\\n\\n\\nOk, you're writing about situation that user want edit images as 24bit\\nand user want edit individual colors -- your questions, by the way,\\njumps off the discussion a bit.\\n\\nMy solution doesn't work, because there's no colormap withing real 24bit\\nimage -- you see, user see 24bit image; going back to 8bit is silly.\\n\\n\\nAbout changing individual colors in 8bit/quantized/rasterized image:\\nchanging individual colors in colormap is useless in most\\ncases if the image is quantized and rasterized -- small change may\\nmake serious errors to anywhere in the image.\\nXV allows this feature, but I don't recommend to use it with the\\nmentioned type images.\\n\\nMoreover, XV is not a paint program; you can only make those global\\nchanges. In full 24bit XV, changing individual colors sounds like\\npaint program job.\\nIf person have 8bit screen, there's need for tricks to get the\\noriginal 24bit image modified. Because user don't see full 24bit\\nimage, there's need to make approximations and it is not possible to\\nmodify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups (if\\nimage is rasterized). To select indiavidual color, there could be 7x7\\ncursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area --\\nselecting individual color is possible from that.\\n\\nOk, I don't have thought very much 24bit painting programs, never seen\\nsuch in good view and are not planned to make such. Not to mention\\n24bit painting program in 8bit screen...\\n\\n\\n\\nIt saved 8bit/quantized/rasterized images as 24bit jpegs; jpeg is not\\ndesigned for that.\\nAlso, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; say,\\nperson would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is\\nexpected that the image still is the same. So, XV were designed\\nwithout thinking about human interface and how human expect the\\nprogram work -- design error.\\n\\nI have heard XV were designed first for 8bit images/files, but\\nit were not good idea to take full 24bit images without making\\nmajor change to the original design.\\n\\nSo, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved\\nimages could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.\\n\\nBefore anybody will make a note: yes, I may as well make a lift where\\n'up' means that the lift goes down and 'down' means that the lift goes\\nup, and put a note on this design solution to the manuals -- however,\\neven the manuals tells the correct situation, it doesn't solve the problem.\\n(Americans: the lift is just an example :)\\n\\n\\nWell, my text may be a bit hard reading, hopefully you suggeeded to\\nread it.\\n\",\n",

Sorry guys, the \\nargument that Jesus may not have existed is a dead point now.  He did.  \\nWhether he was God or whether there is a God is a completely different \\nstory, however. \\n*****************************************************************************\\n\",\n",

In the past it seems to me there were always two \\ncoexisting methods of social control.\\n\\nFirst (and most explicit) is legal control.  That is the set of \\nactions we define as currently illegal and having a specifically defined set \\nof punishments.\\n\\nSecondly (and somewhat more hidden) is social control.  These are \\nthe actions which are considered socially unacceptable and while not covered \\nby legal control, are scrictly controled by social censure. Ideally (if \\nsocialization is working as it should) legal control is hardly ever needed \\nsince most people voluntarilly control their actions due to the pressure of \\nsocial censure.\\n\\nThe control manifests itself in day-to-day life as \"guilt\" and \\n\"morality\".  I\\'ve heard it said (and fully believe) that if it weren\\'t for \\nthe VAST majority of people policing themselves, legal control would be \\nabsolutely impossible.\\n\\nLately (last 50, 100 years?) however there has been a move to \\nattempt to dissengage the individual from societal control (ie. if it ain\\'t \\nillegal, then don\\'t pick on me).  I\\'m not saying this is wrong, merely \\nthat it is a byproduct of a society which has:\\n\\n\\t1) A high education level,\\n\\t2) A high exposure to alternative ideas via the popular media,\\n\\t3) A high level of institutionalized individual rights, and\\n\\t4) A \"me\" oriented culture.\\n\\nI guess what I\\'m saying is that we appear to be in a state of transition, \\nhere in the western world in that we still have many ideas about what we can\\\\\\ncan\\'t allow people to do based entirely on personal squeamishness, yet we \\nare fully bent on maximizing individual freedoms to the max as long as \\nthose freedoms don\\'t impinge on another\\'s.\\n\\nIMHO society is trying to persue two mutually exclusive ends here.  While we \\nappreciate and persue individual rights (these satisfy the old \\nterritoriality and dominance instincts), the removal of socialized, \\ninherent fears based on ignorance will result in the \\ncontinued destabilization of society.  \\n\\nI got no quick fix.

Feeling and guilt are mutally exclusive.  Feelings are a \\nreaction from guilt.  Jesus is talking about the guilt state, not the \\nreaction.   Let me give you an example:\\n\\nHave you ever made a mistake?  Have you ever lied to someone?  Even a\\nlittle white lie?   Have you ever claimed to know something that you really \\ndidn\\'t know?  Have you ever hated someone?  Have you ever been selfish?\\nAre you guilty of any one of these?   The answer is of course, YES.  You\\nare guilty.  Period.  That is it what Jesus is getting at.  No big surprise.  \\nFeelings do not even enter the picture.   Consider Jesus\\'s use of the word\\n\"guilt\" as how a court uses it.\\n\\nJesus is concerned that everyone should admit that they are guilty of being\\nimperfect.  The Bible calls it the state that we are all sinners.  We all do\\nbad things.  Even the most insignficant thing that we do wrong is proof of our \\nguilt that we are all sinners.     It is it in our nature to do bad things. \\nWe are sinners, therefore we do bad things.  Being a sinner is fact.  It is\\nnot a pleasant fact.  But it is just a fact.  We are not perfect.   Calling us\\nsinners should have no more emotional charge to you than calling you a\\nhuman being.  Guilty as charged.\\n\\n\\nYou can handle your guilt in one of two ways:  Acknowledge you\\nmade a mistake, learn from it, and try to not do it again--in\\nthe meantime, not punishing yourself for it:  which is the\\nway Jesus wants you to handle or it.  This is the healthy way.\\n\\nOr two, the destructive way:  put yourself down, slap yourself\\nand feel like crap, never forgive yourself, force yourself to\\nsay a thousand Hail Marys . . . even to suicide.  This the way \\nJesus does NOT want us to deal with it.   All people fall into this \\ncategory to some extent in their lives.\\n\\nJesus is not in the business of saving us from this guilt\\nfeeling.  Jesus is in the business of showing us how much he\\nloves us despite our guilt.  Jesus knows we are guilty.  That\\nisn\\'t new to him.  It is no big deal to him. He just wants you to realize \\nthat this sinful nature destroys the relationship between you and him.\\nThat is what he wants you to know.  Why, because he wants to \\nhave your company.  You are immensely valuable to him.\\nJesus wants a relationship with you, however, in our present\\nsinful nature, we are incapable of having this relationship.  \\n\\nGod is perfect.  We are not.  You cannot fit a square peg into\\na round hole.  However, God has provided a way for us to\\nchange our nature so that we can have a relationship with him.\\nGod has provided Jesus, so that whosoever just believes in\\nJesus, will have their nature changed.  The Holy Spirit will\\nmove it.  And now divine nature is now within lives our very\\nbeing--and us and God communicate with each through his\\nunifying Holy Spirit.  The benefits of this are endless.  For\\nwith the divine nature living within us, we can now see\\nour imperfections better.  We can now head them off at the pass.  With\\nthe power of the Holy Spirit living in us, we now have his power\\nto help us overcome our shortcomings.   Because the divine nature lives \\nwithin us, we can now understand profound Bible passages that never before\\nwe could understand.  Because the divine nature now lives within us, we now \\nhave authority over demonic forces.  And lastly, because the divine \\nnature now lives within us, we have eternal life--for the Holy Spirit\\nis eternal.\\n\\nThe relationship with Jesus is of the utmost importance.  Because\\nit is not what you do in life that qualifies you to belong to\\nheavenly kingdom, it is your relationship to the living God.\\nRemember what Jesus said at the tail end of Matthew when he\\nseparated the \"goats from the sheep\".   Many people in the\\nlast day will ask him, \"Didn\\'t I prophesy in your name and do\\nmiracles, and do good things in your name?\"   And what did Jesus say?\\n\"Depart from me, for I never *knew* you.\"  That is the cornerstone of \\nChristianity, Kent.  Jesus must know you as his friend.  It is your \\nrelationship to Jesus.  If he is your friend and you are his, you will\\nbe counted among those who will share in his inheritance in heaven.  \\n\\n\\nGood.  It shows that you have a strong self-image--that you\\nlove yourself.  That is the second greatest commandment Jesus\\ntaught.  If only more people could do as you do.   As I said before, \\nin the common english venacular, \"feeling guilty\" has a\\ndifferent meaning than the state of guilt.\\n\\n\\nI believe what we all need in our personalities is a lot less ego,\\na lot less self-centeredness, and a lot more unconditional love.\\n',\n",

Let\\'s consider some \"personal interpretations\"\\nand see how much trust we should put in \"Orthodox Mormonism\", which\\ncould never be confused with Orthodox Christianity.\\n\\n        In one of his attacks on Christians, the Mormon Apostle Bruce R.\\nMcConkie said they \"thrash around in...darkness in trying to identify\\nElohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the promised\\nMessiah.\" He also said Christians are wrong to believe \"that Jehovah is\\nthe Supreme Deity [God the Father],\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. McConkie then stated what Mormons\\nbelieve today to be the truth about the matter. He said that \"Elohim is\\nthe Father\" and \"Jehovah is the Son.\"\\n\\n  \"Being thus aware of how far astray the religious intellectualists\\n  have gone in defining their three-in-one God, it comes as no surprise\\n  to learn that they thrash around in the same darkness in trying to\\n  identify Elohim and Jehovah and to show their relationship to the\\n  promised Messiah. Some sectarians even believe that Jehovah is the\\n  Supreme Deity whose Son came into mortality as the Only Begotten. As\\n  with their concept that God is a Spirit, this misinformation about the\\n  Gods of Heaven is untrue. The fact is, and it too is attested by Holy\\n  Writ, that Elohim is the Father, and that Jehovah is the Son who was\\n  born into mortality as the Lord Jesus Christ, the promised Messiah.\\n  (Promised Messiah, p. 100)\\n\\n        Notice that McConkie said the Christians are as wrong about\\ntheir \"three-in-one God\" and their belief that \"God is a Spirit\" as they\\nare in their understanding of who \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" are. Before\\nexamining McConkie\\'s attack and its validity, we shall read a few more\\nstatements by McConkie and other Mormon sources concerning the words\\n\"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah.\" McConkie stated:\\n\\n  \"...the chief designation of Christ that has been preserved for us in\\n  the Old Testament, as that ancient work is now published, is the\\n  exalted name-title Jehovah. (Promised Messiah, p. 367)\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\n  name-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\n  supremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods. (Mormon\\n  Doctrine, p. 224)\\n\\n        Agreeing with McConkie on the question of who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are, the Apostle James E. Talmage stated:\\n\\n  \"_Elohim_, as understood and used in the restored Church of Jesus\\n  Christ, is the name-title of God the Eternal Father, whose firstborn\\n  Son in the spirit is _Jehovah_ -- the Only Begotten in the flesh,\\n  Jesus Christ. (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        \"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and the Twelve\"\\napostles of the Mormon Church states that \"God the Eternal Father...[is]\\ndesignate[d] by the exalted name-title \\'Elohim\\'...\" (Articles of Faith,\\np. 466) \"...Christ in His preexistent, antemortal, or unembodied\\nstate...was known as Jehovah...\" (Articles of Faith, p. 471)\\n\\n        Today Mormon leaders teach that \"Elohim\" in the OT refers to God\\nthe Father and \"Jehovah\" refers to Christ. McConkie attacked Christians\\nfor saying \"Jehovah\" can refer to the Father. He stressed that these two\\n\"name-titles\" should not be changed around so that Christ is called\\n\"Elohim\" and the Father is called \"Jehovah.\" \"...the Father...is Elohim,\\nnot Jehovah.... Jehovah is Christ, and Christ is Jehovah; they are one\\nand the same person.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 111)\\n\\n        In the OT of the KJV of the Bible, the Hebrew word \"Elohim\" is\\nused to refer to the true God, false gods and goddesses, and the judges\\nof Israel. When referring to the true God, \"Elohim\" is translated with a\\ncapital \"G.\" When referring to false gods and goddesses and the judges\\nof Israel, it is translated with a small \"g.\" It is translated four\\ntimes as \"judges\" (Exod. 21:6; 22:8-9), once as \"judge\" (1 Sam. 2:25),\\ntwice as \"mighty\" (Gen. 23:6; Exod. 9:28), once as \"angels\" (Ps. 8:5),\\nonce as \"godly\" (Mal. 2:15), once as \"great\" (Gen. 30:8), and once as\\n\"very great.\" (1 Sam. 14:15)\\n\\n        The word \"Jehovah\" is the traditional pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation YHWH or YHVH with the vowel points taken from the word\\n\"Adonai.\"  Many people believe the true pronunciation of the\\ntetragrammation was Yahweh or Yahveh. However, since \"Jehovah\" rather\\nthan Yahweh is the word used by Mormonism, this section will also use\\n\"Jehovah\" instead of Yahweh to examine the validity of the claims of\\nMormon leaders regarding that name. \"Jehovah,\" unlike \"Elohim,\" is never\\nused of false gods. It is the personal name of the triune God of the\\nBible. In the KJV, \"Jehovah\" is rendered primarily \"LORD,\" sometimes\\n\"GOD,\" and rarely \"Lord.\"\\n\\n        Now that we understand something about the words \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" and their use by Mormon leaders, we shall consider the Apostle\\nMcConkie\\'s attack on Christians for believing the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\nIn trying to prove that \"Jehovah\" refers exclusively to Christ, McConkie\\ncited several verses from the Bible. Some of these verses and McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of them will be examined to see whether he was right.\\nRemember, McConkie said the Father is not \"Jehovah;\" He is only\\n\"Elohim.\" The first example we shall consider involves McConkie\\'s\\ninterpretation of Ps. 110:1. Of this verse he stated:\\n\\n  \"Of whom spake David when his tongue was touched by the Holy Spirit\\n  and he testified, \"The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?\" (Ps. 110:1.) Two\\n  Lords are here involved: one is speaking to the other; one is greater\\n  than the other; one is making provision for the triumph and glory of\\n  the other. Who are they and what message is contained in this\\n  Messianic prophecy?\\n  \"What think ye of Christ?\" our Lord asked certain of his detractors\\n  toward the end of his mortal ministry. \"Whose son is he?\" Is Christ\\n  the Son of God or of someone else? Is he to be born of a divine Parent\\n  or will he be as other men -- a mortal son of a mortal father? That he\\n  was to be a descendant of David was a matter of great pride to all the\\n  Jews. And so they answered, \"The Son of David.\"\\n  David\\'s son? Truly he was. But he was more, much more. And so our\\n  Lord, with irrefutable logic and to their complete discomfiture,\\n  asked, \"How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord\\n  said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine\\n  enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his\\n  son?\" That is, if he is only the Son of David, how is it that the\\n  great King, acting under inspiration, calls him Lord and worships him\\n  as such? And we might add: _Who is the other Lord, the one who spake\\n  unto David\\'s Lord?_ Can there be any question as to how Jesus is\\n  interpreting the words of the Psalm? He is saying that it means: \\'_The\\n  Father said unto the Son, Elohim said unto Jehovah_, sit thou on my\\n  right hand, until after your mortal ministry; then I will raise you up\\n  to eternal glory and exaltation with me, where you will continue to\\n  sit on my right hand forever.\\' (Promised Messiah, pp. 101-102)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Agreeing with the above statement by McConkie, the following\\nremark in the Mormon pamphlet _What the Mormons Think of Christ, p. 6\\nreads: \"The Lord [Elohim, the Father] said unto my Lord [Jehovah, the\\nSon]...\" (brackets in original)\\n\\n        McConkie clearly stated that it is \"Elohim\" the Father who is\\nspeaking to \"Jehovah\" the Son in this Psalm. However, when one looks at\\nthe Hebrew word translated \"LORD,\" it becomes apparent that either the\\nfirst \"LORD\" is not the Father or else the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Either\\nway McConkie is wrong. The Psalm reads:\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] said unto my Lord [Adon], Sit thou at my right\\n  hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool. (Ps. 110:1)\\n\\n        The first \"LORD\" in this verse is \"Jehovah\" who Mormonism says\\nis Christ, not the Father. The second \"Lord\" is the Hebrew word \"Adon\"\\n(singular for \"Adonai,\" meaning master or lord). If the first \"LORD\" is\\nthe Father and the second \"Lord\" is the Son, then the Father is\\n\"Jehovah\" and the Son is \"Adon.\" However, if the Father is not \"Jehovah\"\\nas McConkie claimed, then the first \"LORD\" is \"Jehovah\" the Son, but\\nwho, then, is \"Adon?\" Obviously the Father is \"Jehovah\" in this Psalm,\\nand His Son is \"Adon.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 42:6 about which McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"I the Lord have called thee in righteousness,\" _Isaiah quoted the\\n  Father as saying of Christ_, \"and will hold thine hand, and will keep\\n  thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, for a light of the\\n  Gentiles.\" (Isa. 42:6.) (Promised Messiah, p. 81) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie said the Father was speaking of Christ in this passage\\nwhich reads:\\n\\n  \"I the LORD [Jehovah] have called thee in righteousness, and will hold\\n  thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant of the\\n  people, for a light of the Gentiles. (Isa. 42:6)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, \"I the LORD\" refers to the Father, and\\n\"thine\" and \"thee\" refer to Christ. However, the \"LORD\" who is speaking\\nis \"Jehovah\" which means either McConkie was wrong about who is speaking\\nor else the Father is \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 22:7-8. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  shoot out the lip, they shake the head, saying, He trusted on the Lord\\n  that he would deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in\\n  him.\" (Ps. 22:7-8.) _The fulfillment, as Jesus hung on the cross_, is\\n  found in these words: \"The chief priests mocking him, with the scribes\\n  and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be\\n  the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will\\n  believe him. He trusted in God; let him deliver him now, if he will\\n  have him: for he said, I am the Son of God. The thieves also, which\\n  were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.\" (Matt.\\n  27:41-44.) (Promised Messiah, pp. 530-531) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Ps. 22:7-8 reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip, they\\n  shake the head, saying, He trusted on the LORD [Jehovah] that he would\\n  deliver him: let him deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses had their fulfillment \"as Jesus hung\\non the cross.\" That means the person who was scorned in these verses was\\nChrist. Who, then, was the \"LORD\" in whom he trusted? It was \"Jehovah\"\\nthe Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 31:13 and Ps. 41:9. Regarding them,\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"With reference to the conniving and conspiring plots incident to our\\n  Lord\\'s arrest and judicial trials the prophecy was: \"They took counsel\\n  together against me, they devised to take away my life.\" (Ps. 31:13.)\\n  \"Mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\" (Ps. 41:9.) (Promised\\n  Messiah, p. 532)\\n\\n        Apostle McConkie said these Psalms refer to Christ\\'s \"arrest and\\njudicial trials.\" We shall first consider Ps. 31 and then Ps. 41. While\\nMcConkie only quoted verse 13 of Ps. 31, verse 14 will also be included\\nto give a complete understanding of the matter.\\n\\n  \"For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side: while\\n  they took counsel together against me, they devised to take away my\\n  life. But I trusted in thee, O LORD [Jehovah]: I said, Thou art my God\\n  [Elohim]. (Ps. 31:13-14)\\n\\n        McConkie said verse 13 referred to Jesus Christ. Verse 14 goes\\non to tell that He (Christ) trusted in the \"LORD\" who is called His\\n\"God\" or \"Elohim.\" Mormonism teaches that the God above Jesus is\\n\"Elohim\" the Father. Verse 14, however, reveals that the \"Elohim\" of the\\nman Jesus is \"Jehovah\" the Father.\\n\\n        In Ps. 41, McConkie only quoted one verse; however, two verses\\nwill be considered in this examination.\\n\\n  \"Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my\\n  bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.\\n  But thou, O LORD [Jehovah], be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that\\n  I may requite them. (Ps. 41:9-10)\\n\\n        McConkie stated above that verse 9 referred to Judas\\' role in\\nChrist\\'s death. Since it was Judas who was the \"familiar friend\" who\\n\"lifted up his heel,\" the pronouns \"mine,\" \"I,\" \"my,\" and \"me\" in verse\\n9 must refer to Christ. Notice that at the beginning of verse 10 there\\nis a change of pronoun to \"thou,\" which refers to the \"LORD\" (Jehovah).\\nThen the pronouns \"me\" and \"I\" which refer to Christ are used again.\\nThat means Christ was speaking to \"Jehovah\" the Father in these verses.\\n\\n        Another example involves McConkie\\'s following remark about Ps.\\n        110:4.\\n\\n  \"One of the great Messianic prophecies, spoken by the mouth of David,\\n  ever after the order of Melchizedek.\" (Ps. 110:4.) (Promised Messiah,\\n  p. 450)\\n\\n        McConkie admitted this is a Messianic prophecy involving Christ.\\nThe question is, What in this verse refers to Christ?\\n\\n  \"The LORD [Jehovah] hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest\\n  for ever after the order of Melchizedek. (Ps. 110:4)\\n\\n        Does the \"LORD,\" which is \"Jehovah,\" refer to Christ? If\\nMcConkie is right and Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but the Father is not, then\\nthe \"LORD\" would have to refer to Christ. But who, then, is the one\\naddressed as the \"priest forever after the order of Melchizedek?\" The\\nBible reveals that the one referred to is Jesus Christ (Heb. 5:8-10;\\n6:20; 7); therefore, the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) in Ps. 110:4 is the Father.\\n\\n        Another example involves Isa. 53:4-12. Of these verses McConkie\\nstated:\\n\\n  \"Of the atoning sacrifice of the future Messiah, Isaiah said...\\n     The _Lord_ has laid on him the iniquities of us all....\\n     It pleased the _Lord_ to bruise him... (Promised Messiah, p. 234)\\n     (emphasis added)\\n\\n        McConkie rightly said these verses refer to \"the atoning\\nsacrifice of the future Messiah.\" However, what he failed to mention is\\nthat they also prove that the Father is \"Jehovah.\" Verse 6 reads: \"All\\nwe like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way;\\nand the LORD [Jehovah] hath laid on him [Christ] the iniquity of us\\nall,\" and verse 10 reads: \"Yet it pleased the LORD [Jehovah] to bruise\\nhim [Christ]...\"\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" who laid on Christ \"the iniquity of us all\"\\nand who bruised Him is God the Father who is called \"Jehovah\" in these\\nverses.\\n\\n        Remember, McConkie stated that \"some sectarians even believe\\nthat Jehovah is the Supreme Deity,\" and that Christ \"came into\\nmortality\" as His \"Only Begotten\" Son. He called this concept\\n\"misinformation\" that is \"untrue.\" To prove that it is McConkie who is\\nmisinformed and believing untruth, two Scriptural references (2 Sam.\\n7:14; Ps. 2:7) will be examined. McConkie stated the following regarding\\nthese Scriptures:\\n\\n  \"In the midst of a passage that is clearly Messianic, the Lord says of\\n  the Seed of David: \"I will be his father, and he shall be my son.\" (2\\n  Sam. 7:14.) In the second Psalm, the whole of which is also clearly\\n  Messianic, occurs this statement: \"Thou art my Son; this day have I\\n  begotten thee.\" (Ps. 2:7.) Paul quotes both of these statements in\\n  Hebrews 1:5 and says they are prophecies that Christ would come as the\\n  Son of God. (Promised Messiah, p. 143)\\n\\n        McConkie cited Heb. 1:5 to show that 2 Sam. 7:14 and Ps. 2:7\\nrefer to Christ who \"would come as the Son of God.\" Since McConkie first\\nreferenced 2 Sam. 7:14, this examination will, too. However, along with\\nverse 14, verses 11-13 will also be included.\\n\\n  \"And as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people\\n  Israel, and have caused thee to rest from all thine enemies. Also the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] telleth thee that he will make thee an house.\\n  And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers,\\n  I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy\\n  bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.\\n  He shall build an house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of\\n  his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son. (2\\n  Sam. 7:11-14)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) would have a Son,\\nthe Messiah.\\n        In the second example McConkie cited Ps. 2:7. This examination\\nwill include verse 8. Notice that it is the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) who says,\\n\"Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\"\\n\\n  \"I will declare the decree: the LORD [Jehovah] hath said unto me, Thou\\n  art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.\\n  Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine inheritance,\\n  and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.\\n\\n        McConkie said these verses of Scripture are \"clearly Messianic,\"\\nand he acknowledged they teach that \"Christ would come as the Son of\\nGod.\" What he is not willing to acknowledge, however, is that these\\nScriptures also teach that the Father is \"Jehovah\" and that the\\n\"sectarians\" who believe \"Jehovah is the Supreme Deity whose Son\" is\\nJesus Christ, \"the Only Begotten,\" are right in their belief.\\n\\n        Another example involves Mic. 5:4. Of this verse McConkie stated\\nthe following:\\n\\n  \"And so, truly, did our Lord act _during his mortal ministry! Truly,\\n  this is he of whom it is written_: \"He shall stand and feed in the\\n  strength of the Lord, in the majesty of the name of the LORD his\\n  God... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\" (Mic.\\n  5:4.) (Promised Messiah, p. 182) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        According to McConkie, the pronoun \"He\" at the beginning of Mic.\\n5:4 refers to Christ \"during his mortal ministry.\" Who, then, is the\\n\"LORD his God?\" Mic. 5:4 reads:\\n\\n  \"And he [Christ] shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], in the majesty of the name of the LORD [Jehovah] his God\\n  [Elohim]... for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.\\n\\n        Obviously the \"LORD\" of Jesus Christ is \"Jehovah\" the Father who\\nis referred to as \"Jehovah his Elohim.\"\\n\\n        Another example involves Ps. 2:2 and Isa. 61:1. Of these verses\\nMcConkie stated the following:\\n\\n  \"A number of Messianic passages speak of \"the Lord, and...his\\n  anointed\" (Ps. 2:2), signifying that the Chosen One was consecrated\\n  and set apart for the ministry and mission that was his. _Jesus\\n  applied these passages to himself_ by quoting Isaiah\\'s prophecy. \"The\\n  Lord hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek\" (Isa.\\n  61:1), and then saying: \"This day is this scripture fulfilled in your\\n  ears\" (Luke 4:21). (Promised Messiah, pp. 182-183) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        The first source McConkie quoted -- Ps. 2:2 -- reads as follows:\\n\\n  \"The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel\\n  together, against the LORD [Jehovah], and against his anointed.\\n\\n        McConkie said the \"anointed\" one was Christ. If that is true,\\nwho was \"Jehovah?\" If \"Jehovah\" is always Christ, who was the \"anointed\"\\none? Obviously \"Jehovah\" is referring to God the Father and the\\n\"anointed\" is indeed referring to Christ. The second source McConkie\\ncited is Isa. 61:1 which states:\\n\\n  \"The Spirit of the Lord [Adonai] GOD [Jehovah] is upon me; because the\\n  LORD [Jehovah] hath anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek;\\n  he hath sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to\\n  the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;\\n\\n        The one who was anointed to preach, bind up, proclaim, and open\\nwas Jesus Christ. Who, then, was the one who anointed Him? This verse\\nsays the \"LORD\" (Jehovah) did the anointing. Again, we face the same\\nproblem. If \"Jehovah\" does not refer to the Father, but only to Christ,\\nthen Jesus anointed someone, but who? As McConkie pointed out, \"Jesus\\napplied these passages to himself.\" Therefore, the \"Jehovah\" who\\nanointed Christ is God the Father.\\n\\n        Other examples could be cited to show that McConkie and other\\nMormon leaders are wrong when they say God the Father is not \"Jehovah.\"\\nHowever, these should be enough to expose their error.\\n\\n        Now, what about Mormonism\\'s claim that Jesus is \"Jehovah,\" but\\nHe is not \"Elohim?\" It is true that Jesus is \"Jehovah.\" The following\\nScriptures prove this fact:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] the King of Israel, and his redeemer\\n  the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and\\n  beside me there is no God. (Isa. 44:6)\\n  [Jesus said] ...I am the first and the last: I am he that liveth, and\\n  was dead... (Rev. 1:17-18)\\n\\n  \"...saith the LORD [Jehovah]...they shall look upon me whom they have\\n  pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only\\n  son...

(Joel 2:32)\\n  \"...the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth...there is none other name\\n  under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved. (Acts 4:10,12)\\n\\n  \"Behold, the Lord GOD [Jehovah] will come with strong hand...his\\n  reward is with him... (Isa. 40:10)\\n  ...Behold, I [Christ] come quickly; and my reward is with me... (Rev.\\n  22:12)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah] my God shall come, and all the saints with\\n  thee. (Zech. 14:5)\\n  \"...at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.

(Ps. 83:13,16,18)\\n\\n        The Bible clearly teaches that \"Jehovah\" is \"Elohim.\" In fact,\\nHe is the only \"Elohim\" there is. He is the \"true,\" the \"living,\" the\\n\"mighty,\" the \"great,\" and the \"everlasting Elohim.\" He is the \"Elohim\"\\nof Israel, of all the kingdoms of the earth, and of the heavens. He is\\nthe Creator who made the heavens and all their host and the earth and\\nall that dwell thereon. \"Jehovah\\'s\" name is \"Elohim of hosts.\" (Amos\\n5:27)\\n\\n        Not only is \"Jehovah,\" \"Elohim,\" but \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah.\" The\\nBible reveals that \"Elohim\\'s\" name is \"Jah\" (Ps. 68:4), \"Jehovah\" (Ps.\\n83:18), and \"Jehovah of hosts.\" (2 Sam. 6:2; Jer. 32:18)   The nation\\nwhose \"Elohim\" is \"Jehovah\" is blessed. (Ps. 33:12) Clearly, this is not\\nthe \"Jehovah\" and \"Elohim\" of the Mormons.\\n\\n        Another Mormon error regarding \"Elohim\" and \"Jehovah\" is the\\nbelief that \"Elohim,\" not \"Jehovah,\" is the Father of all the spirits,\\nincluding Jesus. In the Articles of Faith by Apostle James E. Talmage,\\n\"A Doctrinal Exposition by The First Presidency and The Twelve\" apostles\\nstates that \"God the Eternal Father...\\'Elohim,\\' is the literal Parent\\nof...the spirits of the human race.\" (p. 466) This \"Doctrinal\\nExposition\" also states explicitly that \"Jesus Christ is not the Father\\nof the spirits who have taken or yet shall take bodies upon this earth,\\nfor He is one of them. He is The Son, as they are sons and daughters of\\nElohim.\" (p. 473)\\n\\n        The Apostle Talmage stated that \"_Elohim_...is the name-title of\\nGod the Eternal Father, whose firstborn Son in the spirit is\\n_Jehovah_--\" (Jesus the Christ, p. 38)\\n\\n        The Apostle Bruce R. McConkie stated the following about this\\nmatter: \"...Jehovah-Christ...did in fact create the earth and all forms\\nof plant and animal life on the face thereof. _But when it came to\\nplacing man on earth, there was a change in Creators_. That is, the\\nFather himself became personally involved. All things were created by\\nthe Son, using the power delegated by the Father, except man. _In the\\nspirit and again in the flesh, man was created by the Father_. There was\\nno delegation of authority where the crowning creature of creation was\\nconcerned.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 62) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Mormon leaders claim that \"Jehovah-Christ\" did not create either\\nman\\'s spirit or his body. They maintain that the Mormon \"Elohim,\" who is\\nthe father, created man both in spirit and body. The Bible reveals the\\ntruth about who created man.\\n\\n  \"And Moses spake unto the LORD [Jehovah], saying,\\n  Let the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] of the _spirits of all\\n  flesh_, set a man over the congregation. (Num. 27:15-16. See also\\n  16:20-23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah], which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth\\n  the foundation of the earth, and _formeth the spirit of man within\\n  him_. (Zech. 12:1) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the LORD [Jehovah]...made us this soul... (Jer. 38:16)\\n\\n  \"For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for\\n  the spirit should fail before me, and the _souls which I have\\n  made_....\\n  ...saith the LORD [Jehovah]... (Isa. 57:16,19) (emphasis on \"souls...I\\n  have made\" added)\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am the LORD [Jehovah], the God [Elohim] _of all flesh_...\\n  (Jer. 32:27) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that _formed thee\\n  from the womb_.\\n  I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things... (Isa. 44:24)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah]...\\n  I have made the earth, and _created man_ upon it... (Isa. 45:11-12)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...God [Elohim] created man upon the earth...\\n  Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] he is God [Elohim]; there is none else beside him. (Deut.\\n  4:32,35)\\n\\n  \"Thus saith God [El] the LORD [Jehovah]...he that spread forth the\\n  earth, and that which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the\\n  people upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein. (Isa. 42:5)\\n\\n  \"...Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah] of hosts, the God [Elohim] of\\n  Israel... I have made the earth, _the man_ and the beast that are upon\\n  the ground... (Jer. 27:4-5) (most emphasis added)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals that it is \"Jehovah\" who is the \"Elohim of the\\nspirits of all flesh\" and \"of all flesh\" itself, that it was He who\\n\"formed the spirit of man within him,\" that He \"made us this soul\" and\\n\"formed us from the womb.\" He did indeed \"create man.\"\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say Jesus is \"Jehovah,\"\\nthen they are wrong when they say he did not create man. If they are\\nright when they say the father is the one who created man, then they are\\nwrong when they say he is not \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n        Although Mormon leaders teach that Jesus did not create man,\\nMormon scriptures teach that he did. The BoM states the following:\\n\\n  \"Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son....\\n  And never have I showed myself unto _man whom I have created_, for\\n  never has man believed in me as thou hast....\\n  Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and\\n  _man have I created_ after the body of my spirit... (Eth. 3:14-16)\\n  (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is _I\\n  that hath created them_... (Mos. 26:23) (emphasis added)\\n\\n  \"...the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of\\n  Jacob...is that same God who created the heavens and the earth, and\\n  all things that in them are.\\n  Behold _he created Adam_... (Mor. 9:11-12) (emphasis added)\\n\\n        D&C, 93:10 states that \"the worlds were made by him [Christ];\\n_men were made by him_; all things were made by him, and through him,\\nand of him.\" (emphasis added)\\n\\n        Another error by Bruce R. McConkie involving \"Jehovah\" and his\\ncreation is the belief that \"Jehovah\" had \"many\" pre-mortal spirits\\nhelping him create. Included in this alleged group was Joseph Smith, Jr.\\n\\n  \"That he [Christ] was aided in the creation of this earth by \"many of\\n  the noble and great\" spirit children of the Father is evident from\\n  go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these\\n  materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell.\" (Abra.\\n  3:22-24.) Michael or Adam was one of these. Enoch, Noah, Abraham,\\n  Moses, Peter, James, and John, Joseph Smith, and many other \"noble and\\n  great\" ones played a part in the great creative enterprise. (Doctrines\\n  of Salvation, vol. 1, pp. 74-75.) (Mormon Doctrine, p. 169)\\n\\n        The Bible reveals the truth about this matter:\\n\\n  \"Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], thy redeemer, and he that formed thee\\n  from the womb, I am the LORD [Jehovah] that maketh all things; that\\n  stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the earth by\\n  myself. (Isa. 44:24)\\n\\n  \"Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the waves of\\n  the sea. (Job 9:8)\\n\\n        \"Jehovah,\" by Himself, created all things. He had no alleged\\npreexistent spirit helpers assisting Him.\\n\\n        Regarding the Mormon \\'Elohim,\" the Apostle McConkie stated:\\n\"Elohim. plural word though it is, is also used as the exalted\\nname-title of God the Eternal Father, a usage that connotes his\\nsupremacy and omnipotence, he being God above all Gods.\" (Mormon\\nDoctrine, p. 224) He also stated that \"Jesus...is above all save the\\nFather only.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 363)\\n\\n        The Bible states that the One who is God above all so-called\\ngods is the triune God \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is a great God [El], and a great King above\\n  all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 95:3)\\n\\n  \"For thou, LORD [Jehovah], art high above all the earth: thou art\\n  exalted far above all gods [Elohim]. (Ps. 97:9)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11. See also Ps. 135:5; Deut. 10:17)\\n\\n        If Mormon leaders are right when they say \"Jehovah\" is god the\\nson and \"Elohim\" is god the father, these verses from the Bible would be\\nteaching that the Mormon son is above his father. However, as McConkie\\nclearly stated, Mormons believe \"Elohim\" the father, not \"Jehovah\" the\\nson, is the \"God above all Gods\" -- that Jesus is above all except the\\nfather; yet the Bible teaches that \"Jehovah\" is above all \"Elohim.\"\\n\\n        At a BYU Dev. on March 2, 1982, Bruce R. McConkie made the\\nfollowing remark about praying to Jesus:\\n\\n  \"Another peril is that those so involved often begin to pray directly\\n  to Christ because of some special friendship they feel has been\\n  developed....\\n  This is plain sectarian nonsense. Our prayers are addressed to the\\n  Father, and to him only....\\n  ...Perfect prayer is addressed to the Father, in the name of the Son;\\n  it is uttered by the power of the Holy Ghost... (Our Relationship With\\n  the Lord, pp. 19-20)\\n\\n        McConkie states on p. 335 of his book Promised Messiah that the\\nMormons \"pray to the Father, not the Son...\" On p. 306 of the same book\\nMcConkie states that \"Christ [the Son] is Jehovah.\" This is important to\\nremember, because although McConkie said prayer is not to be offered to\\nthe Mormon Christ who is \"Jehovah,\" the Bible states repeatedly in the\\nOT that people prayed to \"Jehovah,\" and He not only heard those prayers,\\nbut He accepted them as valid requests. The following is but a small\\nsample of the vast number of times people prayed to \"Jehovah.\"\\n\\n  \"In my distress I called upon the LORD [Jehovah], and cried unto my\\n  God [Elohim]: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came\\n  before him, even into his ears. (Ps. 18:6)\\n\\n  \"And the LORD [Jehovah] said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thy\\n  supplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed this\\n  house, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mine\\n  eyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually. (1 Kin. 9:3)\\n\\n  \"And said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we beseech thee, our\\n  supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us unto the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] thy God [Elohim], even for all this remnant... (Jer. 42:2)\\n\\n  \"O LORD [Jehovah], I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to\\n  the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who\\n  desire to fear thy name... (Neh. 1:11)\\n\\n  \"And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying all this\\n  prayer and supplication unto the LORD [Jehovah], he arose from before\\n  the altar of the LORD [Jehovah], from kneeling on his knees with his\\n  hands spread up to heaven. (1 Kin. 8:54)\\n\\n  \"He went in therefore, and shut the door upon them twain, and prayed\\n  unto the LORD [Jehovah]. (2 Kin. 4:33)\\n\\n  \"Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD [Jehovah], the God\\n  [Elohim] of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy\\n  tears: behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years. (Isa. 38:5)\\n\\n  \"I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid. I\\n  said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD [Jehovah]; and\\n  thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.\\n  For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when\\n  thou mayest be found... (Ps. 32:5-6)\\n\\n        Notice above in Ps. 32:6 that the \"godly\" pray to \"Jehovah.\"\\nAccording to McConkie and other Mormon leaders, that is Christ the very\\none to whom McConkie said people should not pray.\\n\\n        The Bible reveals there is only one true \"Elohim,\" and His name\\nis \"Jehovah.\" All other \"Elohim\" are false. They are idols that cause\\ntheir followers to commit adultery against the true \"Elohim\" and\\nidolatry.\\n\\n  \"For the LORD [Jehovah] is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to\\n  be feared above all gods [Elohim].\\n  For all the gods [Elohim] of the nations are idols: but the LORD\\n  [Jehovah] made the heavens. (Ps. 96:4-5)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt have no other gods [Elohim] before me. (Exod. 20:3)\\n\\n  \"Now I know that the LORD [Jehovah] is greater than all gods\\n  [Elohim]... (Exod. 18:11)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with them, nor with their gods [Elohim].\\n  They shall not dwell in thy land, lest they make thee sin against me:\\n  for if thou serve their gods [Elohim], it will surely be a snare unto\\n  thee. (Exod. 23:32- 33)\\n\\n  \"Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and ye turn\\n  aside, and serve other gods [Elohim], and worship them. (Deut. 11:16)\\n\\n  \"That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among you;\\n  neither make mention of the name of their gods [Elohim], nor cause to\\n  swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto them.\\n  (Josh. 23:7)\\n\\n  \"...neither walk after other gods [Elohim] to your hurt. (Jer. 7:6)\\n\\n  \"But the LORD [Jehovah] is the true God [Elohim], he is the living God\\n  [Elohim]... (Jer. 10:10)\\n\\n  \"And they forsook the LORD [Jehovah] God [Elohim] of their fathers,\\n  which brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods\\n  [Elohim], of the gods [Elohim] of the people that were round about\\n  them, and bowed themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD [Jehovah]\\n  to anger. (Jud. 2:12)\\n\\n  \"Shall a man make gods [Elohim] unto himself, and they are no gods\\n  [Elohim]? Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I\\n  will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know\\n  that my name is the LORD [Jehovah]. ( Jer. 16:20-21)\\n\\n  \"And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD [Jehovah], choose you\\n  this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods [Elohim] which your\\n  fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods\\n  [Elohim] of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my\\n  house, we will serve the LORD [Jehovah].\\n  And the people answered and said, God [Elohim] forbid that we should\\n  forsake the LORD [Jehovah], to serve other gods [Elohim]. (Josh.\\n  24:15-16)\\n\\n        These verses teach that the only true, living \"Elohim\" in heaven\\nand on earth is \"Jehovah\" -- the triune God who made heaven and earth\\nand all therein.\\n\\n        \"Jehovah\" is greater than any \"Elohim,\" because all other\\n\"Elohim\" are idols. The reality behind them is demonic. (Deut. 32:17)\\n\"Jehovah Elohim\" has given explicit warnings and guidelines regarding\\nthese false \"Elohim.\" He told His people not to have any \"Elohim\" but\\nHim. He told the people that if they left Him for the false \"Elohim,\"\\nthose \"Elohim\" would be a snare to them, and they would be hurt and\\nwould perish. He warned the people to \"take heed\" that their \"heart be\\nnot deceived\" into worshiping, serving, swearing by, and making\\ncovenants with false \"Elohim.\" \"Jehovah Elohim\" told His people He would\\neventually judge all false \"Elohim\" and their followers.\\n\\n        Despite these warnings and guidelines, \"Elohim\\'s\" covenant\\npeople forsook Him and believed in and worshiped the false \"Elohim\\'s\" of\\nthe people they came in contact with. Ju. 10:6 states that \"the children\\nof Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah] and served\\nBaalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods [Elohim] of Syria, and the gods\\n[Elohim] of Zidon, and the gods [Elohim] of Moab, and the gods [Elohim]\\nof the children of Ammon, and the gods [Elohim] of the Philistines, and\\nforsook the LORD [Jehovah], and served not him.\"\\n\\n        This examination has shown that the \"Elohim\" of Mormonism, like\\nthe \"Elohim\" in Ju. 10:6 is not the true \"Jehovah Elohim.\" Therefore,\\nthe people who leave the true \"Elohim\" for the Mormon \"Elohim\" will do\\n\"evil...in the sight of the LORD [Jehovah].\"\\n\\n        Although McConkie attacked Christians for their belief in a\\ntriune God who is Spirit and for their belief that God the Father\\n[Jehovah] sent His Son into the world, these beliefs are true. God is\\ntriune; He is Spirit; He is \"Jehovah;\" and He did send His Son into the\\nworld to redeem mankind.\\n\\n        It is obvious from this examination that it is not the\\nChristians who \"thrash around in...darkness\" about who \"Elohim\" and\\n\"Jehovah\" are. One wonders what \"Holy Writ\" McConkie had in mind when he\\nstated that it attests to the fact that \"Elohim is the Father, and that\\nJehovah is the Son.\" He certainly did not mean the Bible which teaches\\nthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are all the one \"Jehovah Elohim.\"\\nHe apparently did not mean the D&C either, because chapter 109, verses\\n1,4,9-10, 14,19,22,24,29,34,42,47,56,68,77 refer to the Father as\\n\"Jehovah.\"\\n\\nSummary\\n\\n        Obviously Joseph Fielding Smith\\'s statement that the Mormons\\n\"have a clear and perfect understanding of the nature of God\" (Doctrines\\nof Salvation, 1:279) is not accurate. The Mormon gods are not the true\\nGod as Mormonism claims, but are idols which cause their followers to\\ncommit adultery against God and idolatry.\\n\\n        In answer to Jesus\\' question, \"But whom say ye that I am,\"\\nMormons say Jesus is someone different from the Jesus who is revealed in\\nthe Bible and whom the apostles preached. Therefore, anyone trusting in\\nthe Mormon Jesus is believing in \"another Jesus\" whom Paul warned about.\\n\\n        Bernard P. Brockbank, of the First Quorum of the Seventy,\\nadmitted in the May 1977 issue of The Ensign, a Mormon publication, that\\nthe Mormon Jesus is different from the Christian Jesus. He stated that\\n\"it is true that many of the Christian churches worship a different\\nJesus Christ than is worshipped by the Mormons or The Church of Jesus\\nChrist of Latter-day Saints.\" (p. 26)\\n\\n        The people who believe in the Mormon Jesus are committing\\nadultery against God and idolatry. They do not have the Son; therefore,\\nthey do not have the Father, and they do not have eternal life. As the\\nApostle Bruce R. McConkie rightly stated: \"Salvation comes only by\\nworshiping the true God.\" (Promised Messiah, p. 163) McConkie also\\nrightly stated that \"the mere worship of a god who has the proper\\nscriptural names does not assure one that he is worshiping the true and\\nliving God,\" because the \"true names of Deity\" can be applied to \"false\\nconcepts of God.\" (Mormon Doctrine, p. 270) Remember that the Apostle\\nStephen L. Richards admitted that Joseph Smith, Jr., gave \"a new\\nconception of God and the Godhead.\" (Contributions of Joseph Smith, p.\\n1)\\n\\n        It is important for the people who have left the true triune God\\nrevealed in the Bible to repent and return to Him. They must forsake the\\nsins of idolatry and adultery which they are committing in Mormonism.\\n\\n  \"...all that forsake thee shall be ashamed, and they that depart from\\n  me shall be written in the earth, because they have forsaken the LORD\\n  [Jehovah], the fountain of living waters. (Jer. 17:13)\\n\\n  \"And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD [Jehovah] thy God\\n  [Elohim], and walk after other gods [Elohim], and serve them, and\\n  worship them, I testify against you this day that ye shall surely\\n  perish. (Deut. 8:19)\\n\\n  \"Thou shalt make no covenant with...their gods [Elohim]. (Exod. 23:32)\\n\\n  \"...Put away the strange gods [Elohim] that are among you, and be\\n  clean, and change your garments. (Gen. 35:2)\\n\\n  \"...flee from idolatry. (1 Cor. 10:14)\\n\\n        It is necessary that Christians heed the warnings of the Bible.\\nIf they do, they will not fall into the sins of adultery against God and\\nidolatry. Remember, to know the \"only true God\" is eternal life. (John\\n17:3)',\n",

Most of us don\\'t see any\\nreason at all why *more money* should be spent to the effect of *removing\\npersonal choice* from some women.  The alternative is to fund A if that is\\nwhat the mother chooses.  We will also still fund B and even C if *that*\\nis what the mother chooses.  However, some women will certainly choose A,\\nand that will then save us $15 we otherwise would have had to spend.  Your\\n\"taxes\" are not being raised to fund a choice you object, they are being\\n*lowered* because we will fund a choice that is *legal*, despite your\\nobjections to it.  (Actually, your taxes are not really going to go down,\\nas I\\'m sure you would point out.  But the amount that is saved in that\\narea can help out in another--like our massive debt.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThose other procedures you mention only cost money.  There is no savings\\nin other procedures that would be required down the road without them.\\n(In fact, there could be additional costs down the road *because* of them.)\\nThis is quite different from the case of abortion.\\n\\n\\nThis is bullshit.  We are *not* refusing \"to make the alternative affordable\\ntoo\".  If we refused to pay for the more expensive choice of birth, *then*\\nyour statement would make sense.  But that is not the case, so it doesn\\'t.\\nIf Clinton tried to block funding for pre-natal care and delivery (or left\\nit out of his health-care plan), I would certainly object.  I would also be\\nquite surprised.\\n\\n\\n\\nYes, but probably not your definition of it, or for the reasons you think.\\n\\n\\nYOU STUPID FUCK!  *WE DO* want to fund *all* the choices.  *YOU* are the\\none who wants to *NOT* fund all the choices.\\n\\n\\nYour humble opinion is still wrong.  Even with easy adoption, there is still\\nthe fact that pregnancy takes several months.  Months in which a young woman\\ncould need to be getting an education.  (like finishing High School, entering\\ncollege, finishing college, getting a job...things that are much harder to\\ndo if you have to \"take a break\" for a few months...things that have a massive\\nimpact on her future productivity.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYou *can* have a conversation with the \"mentally incompetant\".  And even\\nthough *you* personally may refuse to have a conversation with \"people\\nyou just don\\'t like\", it is still *possible* for others to have a conversation\\nwith them.  It is *not* possible for *anyone* to have a conversation with\\na fetus.\\n\\n\\n\\nHe was still biologically independent.  At least to the same extent you are\\nnow.  He consumed nutrients and digested them in the normal manner.  He\\nbreathed his own air.  A fetus on the other hand, gets it\\'s nutrients already\\ndigested by the mother.  It gets its oxygen from the mother as well.  That\\nis not biologically independent.\\n\\n\\n\\nAwareness is only *part* of what makes a \"member of society\".  It is the\\nminimal conceivable requirement, yet many people seem to think that something\\nwithout awareness could still be important enough to justify the suffereing\\nof a true member of society.  I keep asking, but I still haven\\'t seen a real\\njustification for why the life of a non-sentient creature should be worth the\\nsuffering of a sentient being.

       "  '\\n(about my reply)\\n\\n\\nIt a society that is constantly on the verge of flaming, Usenet, diplomacy\\nis the best way to ensure the voice of reason gets through, isn\\'t it?\\n\\n\\nKevin, unfortunately you are now delving into field I know too little\\nabout, algorithms. Your reasoning, as I see it, is very much along the\\nlines of Roger Penrose, who claimed that mathematical \\'insight\\' cannot\\nbe algorithmic in his book _The emperor\\'s new mind: Concerning\\ncomputers, minds, and the laws of physics_. However, Penrose\\'s\\nclaim that he _has_ mathematical insight, or your similar claim\\nthat wavefunctions collapse only when we consciously take a look,\\ncould be just illusions.\\n\\nWe are obviouslu taking very different viewpoints - I try to ponder\\non the problem of consciousness from an evolutionary perspective,\\nrealising that it might not be anything special, but certainly\\nuseful. Thinking back of what I wrote, do you think worms have minds\\nor not? They are able to experience pain, at least they behave \\njust like that. Yet it is conceivable that we might some day\\nin the future perform a \"total synthesis of C. elegans\" from\\nthe elements. Would such a worm have a mind?\\n\\n\\nThis is true to some extent. However, I do not think that our brains\\nwork like computers, at all. In fact, there is substantial evidence\\n(Skarda, 1985; Skarda & Freeman 1987) that brains work more or less\\nchaotically, generating enough randomness for mental states to evolve.\\nOur brains work much like genetic algorithm generators, I suppose.\\n\\n\\nIndeed, this is extremely unlikely, given the vast impact of nurture\\non our mind and brain. I suggest, however, that before trying to\\nunderstand our consciousness as a collection of algorithms. \\n\\nKevin, take a look at the references I mentioned, and think again.\\nI still think the best experts on the nature of a conscious mind\\nare neurologists, neuropsychologists and biologists (but do not \\nflame me for my opinions), since they study beings that are\\nconscious. \\n\\nThe reason I am repeating my advice is that this discussion cannot\\nlead to anywhere if our backgrounds are too different.\\n\\nAnd please, do not bring QM into this discussion at all - not\\nall physicists are happy with the claim that our consciousness\\nplays some special role in physics. I would say it doesn\\'t.\\n\\n\\nAgain, _brains are not computers_. Don\\'t forget this. This does not\\nmean they need something else to work - they just work differently.\\nTheir primary \\'purpose\\' is perception and guidance of action, \\nself-awareness and high intelligence are later appearances.\\n\\n\\nYou are still expecting that we could find the idea of \\'green\\' in\\nour brains somewhere, perhaps in the form of some chemical. This is\\nnot how I see it. The sensation \\'green\\' is a certain time-dependent\\npattern in the area V4 of our visual cortex, and it is distributed\\nwith the help of areas V1 and V2 to the rest of the brain. \\n\\nIndeed, a firing pattern. I have sometimes thought of our consciousness\\nas a global free induction pattern of these local firing patterns,\\nbut this is just idle speculation.\\n\\nScientific American\\'s September 1992 issue was a special issue on\\nmind and brain. Have you already read it from cover to cover? ;-)\\nThere are two articles on visual perception, so you might be \\ninterested.\\n\\nBut again, please note that subjective experiences cannot be \\nobserved from a third-person perspective. If we see nothing but \\nneuronal activity, we cannot go on to conclude that this is not the\\nmind.\\n\\nKalat (1988) writes about numerous examples where electric stimulation\\nof different areas of brain have led to various changes in the \\npatients\\' state of mind. For instance, a patient whose septal area\\nwas stimulated (without his knowledge) by remote control during\\na psychiatric interview was quickly cured of his depression, and\\nstarted discussing a plan to seduce his girlfriend.\\n\\nStimulations in the temporal lobe have sometimes led to embarrassing\\nsituations, when the patients have started flirting with the\\ntherapist.\\n\\nIn conclusion, there is evidence that\\n\\n1) brains are essentially necessary for subjective experiences, \\n   brain damage is usually equivalent to some sort of mind damage\\n\\n2) conscious processes involve substantial brain activity in\\n   various areas of brain - when we think of colours, our\\n   visual cortex is activated etc.\\n\\n3) consciousness is an afterthought - we become conscious of our\\n   actions with a half a second delay, and our brains are ahead\\n   of our \\'conscious will\\' by at least 350 ms. \\n\\nThus, I think it is fruitful to turn the question \"Why do \\'I\\' see\\ncolours\" around and ask \"What is this \\'I\\' that seems to be \\nobserving?\", since it seems that our conscious mind is not\\nthe king of our brains.\\n\\n\\nThis depends on what is meant by \\'seeing colours\\'. Does a neural\\nnetwork that is capable of recognising handwritten numbers from\\n0 to 9 see the numbers, if it is capable of sorting them?\\n\\nIf you are asking, \"why does an animal who is conscious of itself\\nas an observer have an evolutionary advantage over an animal who\\ndoesn\\'t\", I have a good answer - read my previous posting,\\nwhere I wrote why a sense of identity helps social animals to swap\\nroles and act more morally, so that they don\\'t unconsciously\\nkill each other with newly discovered weapons. (A bit extreme,\\nbut this is the basic idea.)\\n\\nWhen early _Homo_ became more and more efficient in using tools, \\na sense of identity and the concept of \\'self\\' had to evolve in\\nline with this development. Indeed, respect for others and \\nconscious altruistic behaviour might be evolutionary advantages\\nfor social animals, such as early humans. \\n\\n\\nIf minds are required for this, does this mean that until human\\nminds came to the scene, wavefunctions never collapsed, but remained\\nin the superpositions for aeons? My, how powerful we are.\\n\\nThis has been discussed before, and I think this topic is irrelevant,\\nsince we do not agree that minds are necessary, and neither do\\nphysicists. \\n\\n\\nI agree, but not in the sense you apparently mean above - physics\\nneeds sharp minds to solve many real problems. ;-)\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s OK, if you don\\'t forget to take with you the references I\\nwrote about in my previous posting, plus the following:\\n\\nKalat, James W.

I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.\\n#>#The point is that theism is *a* factor.\\n#>\\n#>That\\'s your claim; now back it up.  I consider your argument as useful\\n#>as the following:  Belief is strongly correlated with fanaticism.  Therefore\\n#>belief is *a* factor in fanaticism.  True, and utterly useless.  (Note, this\\n#>is *any* belief, not belief in Gods)\\n#>\\n# \\n#Tiring to say the least. I have backed it up, read the first statement.\\n\\nI have read it.  Conspicuous by its absence is any evidence or point.\\n\\n# \\n#The latter is the fallacy of the wrong analogy. Saying someone believes\\n#something is hardly an information about the person at all. Saying someone\\n#is a theist holds much more information. Further, the correlation between\\n#theists and fanatism is higher than that between belief at all and fanatism\\n#because of the special features of theistic belief.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  Evidence?\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>Gullibility,\\n#>#>blind obedience to authority, lack of scepticism, and so on, are all more\\n#>#>reliable indicators.  And the really dangerous people - the sources of\\n#>#>fanaticism - are often none of these things.  They are cynical manipulators\\n#>#>of the gullible, who know precisely what they are doing.\\n#>#\\n#>#That\\'s a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the\\n#>#field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.\\n#>\\n#>If you believe that, you\\'re incredibly naive.\\n#>\\n# \\n#You, Frank O\\'Dwyer, are living in a dream world. I wonder if there is any\\n#base of discussion left after such a statement. As a matter of fact, I think\\n#you are ignorant of human nature. Even when one starts with something one does\\n#not believe, one gets easily fooled into actually believing what one says.\\n# \\n#To give you the benefit of the doubt, prove your statement.\\n\\nThe onus of proof is on you, sunshine.  What makes you think that\\ntheist leaders believe what they say?  Especially when they say\\none thing and do another, or say one thing closely followed by its\\nopposite?  The practice is not restricted to theism, but it\\'s there\\nfor anyone to see.  It\\'s almost an epidemic in this country.\\n\\nJust for instance, if it is harder for a camel to pass thru\\' the eye\\nof a needle, why is the Catholic church such a wealthy land-owner?  Why\\nare there churches to the square inch in my country?\\n# \\n#>#>Now, *some*\\n#>#>brands of theism, and more precisely *some* theists, do tend to fanaticism,\\n#>#>I grant you.  To tar all theists with this brush is bigotry, not a reasoned\\n#>#>argument - and it reads to me like a warm-up for censorship and restriction\\n#>#>of religious freedom.  Ever read Animal Farm?\\n#>#>\\n#>#That\\'s a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to\\n#>#repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to\\n#>#fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,\\n#>#there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.\\n#>\\n#>No, some of it comes from features which *some* theism has in common\\n#>with *some* fanaticism.    Your last statement simply isn\\'t implied by\\n#>what you say before, because you\\'re trying to sneak in \"innate features\\n#>of [all] theism\".  The word you\\'re groping for is \"some\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Bogus again. Not all theism as is is fanatic. However, the rest already\\n#gives backup for the statement about the correlation about fanatism and\\n#theism. And further, the specialty of other theistic beliefs allows them\\n#to switch to fanatism easily. It takes just a nifty improvement in the\\n#theology.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.\\n#>\\n#>No shit, Sherlock.  So why not talk about gullibility instead of theism,\\n#>since it seems a whole lot more relevant to the case you have, as opposed\\n#>to the case you are trying to make?\\n#>\\n# \\n#Because there is more about theism that the attraction to gullible people\\n#causing the correlation. And the whole discussion started that way by the\\n#statement that theism is meaningfully correlated to fanatism, which you\\n#challenged.\\n\\nIndeed I did.  As I recall, I asked for evidence.  What is the correlation\\nof which you speak?  \\n# \\n# \\n#>#And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw\\n#>#men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.\\n#>\\n#>I said it reads like a warm up to that.  That\\'s because it\\'s an irrational\\n#>and bogus tirade, and has no other use than creating a nice Them/Us\\n#>split in the minds of excitable people such as are to be found on either\\n#>side of church walls.\\n#>\\n# \\n#Blah blah blah. I am quite well aware that giving everyone their rights\\n#protects me better from fanatics than the other way round.\\n\\nOf course, other people are always fanatics, never oneself.  Your\\nwish to slur all theists seems pretty fanatical to me.\\n# \\n#It is quite nice to see that you are actually implying a connection between\\n#that argument and the rise of fanatism.

No proof, no evidence, just claims.\\n\\nHey - I learned it from you. Did I do good?\\n# \\n# \\n#>At the risk of repeating myself, and hearing \"we had that before\" [we\\n#>didn\\'t hear a _refutation_ before, so we\\'re back.   Deal with it] :\\n#>you can\\'t use reason to demonstrate that reason is useful.  Someone\\n#>who thinks reason is crap won\\'t buy it, you see.\\n#>\\n# \\n#That is unusually weak even for you. The latter implies that my proof\\n#depends on their opinion. Somehow who does not accept that there are\\n#triangles won\\'t accept Pythagoras. Wow, that\\'s an incredible insight.\\n#I don\\'t have to prove them wrong in their opinion. It is possible to\\n#show that their systems leave out useful information respectively claims\\n#unreliable or even absurd statements to be information.\\n\\nTotally circular, and totally useless.\\n# \\n#Their wish to believe makes them believe. Things are judges by their appeal,\\n#and not by their information. It makes you feel good when you believe that\\n#may be good for them, but it contains zillions of possible pitfalls. From\\n#belief despite contrary evidence to the bogus proofs they attempt.\\n\\nTruth by blatant assertion.  I\\'ve seen as many bogus proofs of the \\nnon-existence of gods as I have of their existence.\\n\\n# \\n#Rational systems, by the way, does not mean that every data has to come from\\n#logical analysis, the point is that the evaluation of the data does not\\n#contradict logic. It easily follows that such a system does not allows to\\n#evaluate if its rational in itself. Yes, it is possible to evaluate that\\n#it is rational in a system that is not rational by the fallacies of that\\n#system, but since the validity of the axioms is agreed upon, that has as\\n#little impact as the possibility of a demon ala Descartes.\\n\\nThis just doesn\\'t parse, sorry.\\n# \\n#So far it just a matter of consistency.

The\\n#>#>second part of your sentence is patently false - counterexample: an\\n#>#>axiomatic datum does not lend itself to rational analysis, but is\\n#>#>assumed to contain reliable information regardless of what process is\\n#>#>used to obtain it.\\n#>#>\\n#>#\\n#>#I\\'ve been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions\\n#>#of god here.\\n#>#\\n#>#An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here\\n#>#is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the\\n#>#axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems\\n#>#out of which they are usually derived. \"I exist\" is derived, if you want\\n#>#it that way.\\n#>#\\n#>#Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.\\n#>#\\n#>#what is it you are trying to say?\\n#>\\n#>That at some point, people always wind up saying \"this datum is reliable\"\\n#>for no particular reason at all.  Example: \"I am not dreaming\".\\n#>\\n# \\n#Nope. There is evidence for it. The trick is that the choice of an axiomatic\\n#basis of a system is difficult, because the possibilities are interwoven.\\n#One therefore chooses that with the least assumptions or with assumptions\\n#that are necessary to get information out of the system anyway.\\n\\nI\\'d like to see this alleged evidence.\\n# \\n#One does not need to define axioms in order to define an evaluation method\\n#for usefulness, the foundation is laid by how one feels at all (that\\'s not\\n#how one feels about it).\\n\\nI see.  You have no irrational beliefs.  But then, fanatics never do, do\\nthey?\\n\\n# \\n#>#>|Compared the evidence theists have for their claims to the strength of\\n#>#>|their demands makes the whole thing not only irrational but antirational.\\n#>#>\\n#>#>I can\\'t agree with this until you are specific - *which* theism?  To\\n#>#>say that all theism is necessarily antirational requires a proof which\\n#>#>I suspect you do not have.\\n#>#>\\n#>#\\n#>#Using the traditonal definition of gods.

Please\\n#note that subjective data lend themselves to a scientific treatment as well.\\n#They just prohibit formulating them as objective statements.\\n\\nErgo, nothing is objective.  Fair enough.\\n# \\n# \\n#>#>|The affinity to fanatism is easily seen. It has to be true because I believe\\n#>#>|it is nothing more than a work hypothesis.

Now show that a belief\\n#>in gods entails the further contents of which you speak.   Why aren\\'t my\\n#>catholic neighbours out killing the protestants, for example?   Maybe they\\n#>don\\'t believe in it.  Maybe it\\'s the conjunction of \"B asserts B\" and\\n#>\"jail/kill dissenters\" that is important, and the belief in gods is\\n#>entirely irrelevant.  It certainly seems so to me, but then I have no\\n#>axe to grind here.\\n#>\\n# \\n#The example with your neighbours is a fallacy. That *your* neighbours don\\'t\\n#says little about others.

One, protanopia, is caused by a lack or major\\ndysfunction of the L cones, those that respond best to long\\nwavelengths. This gives much reduced red/green and red/violet discrimination and\\nalso means that reds look dimmer than than they do to people with normal vision.\\n\\nThe other, deuteranopia, is due to missing or dysfunctional M cones although it\\ncan also be caused by a lack of the L-M cone difference signals in the retina.\\nIt also gives reduced red/green discrimination but red/violet is unaffected. \\nUnlike protanopia, reds are not dimmer than  normal.\\n\\nOn a uniform chromaticity diagram - the horseshoe shaped one you see in computer\\ngraphics books - there is a single confusion point for each type of colour\\ndeficiency. Colours which are confused lie on straight lines radiating from this\\npoint. For protanopia the point is at u'=0.61,v'=0.51, very close to the far red\\ncorner. For deuteranopia, the point is at u'=-4.75, v'=1.31\\n\\nNote that different experimental investigations in the literature give slightly\\ndifferent values for these depending on the precise details of the experimental\\nsetup, random errors, and so on. The values quoted are typical.\\n\\nSo if all colours on a line are seen as the same, which colour is actually seen?\\n\\nThis problem has now been solved. Tests on people with one normal eye and one\\naffected eye have shown that there is an axis for each type of disorder onto\\nwhich all the colours collapse. For protanopes this joins up 473nm and 574nm on\\nthe spectral locus (the edge of the horseshoe); for deuteranopes the line is\\nvery similar,  joining 477nm and 579nm.\\n\\n*So* to convert colours from normal vision to a simulated protanopia or\\nduuteranopia:\\n\\n1) Plot the colour on a uniform chromaticity diagram\\n2) Construct a line from this point to the appropriate confusion point\\n3) Find the intersection of this line with the appropriate axis line\\n4) This is the new chromaticity. \\n\\nThe best reference for this is Meyer, G.W. & Greenberg, D.P.

You will need the chromaticities of the red\\ngreen and blue phosphors of the monitor you intend to display the images on, and\\nthe chromaticity of the white point. This information can be measured, or\\nobtained from the manufacturer. I posted a list of some monitor chromaticities a\\ncouple of weeks ago.\\n\\nThe procedure, for each pixel (!) is as follows. (Some lookup tables might be a\\nhelp here.)\\n\\nA) convert RGB to CIE XYZ.

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])       # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
