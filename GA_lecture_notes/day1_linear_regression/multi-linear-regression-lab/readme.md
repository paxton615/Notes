# Simple and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) from Scratch

---

### Core
- Code the MSE for regression
- Write a function to calculate the $R^2$ metric
- Evaluate a regression model with $R^2$
- Plot the regression line and predictions against the true values
- Understand the difference between multiple linear regression and simple linear regression
- Explain the 5 assumptions of MLR

### Target
- Conceptualise the difference between R^2 and MSE
- Construct an MLR, calculate the coefficients manually, and evaluate the R^2

### Stretch
- Derive the beta coefficients in MLR using linear algebra
