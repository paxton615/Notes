# Feature Importance

---

### Core
- Describe the concept of feature importance
- Explain how we can identify relative feature importance in linear regression and tree-based models
- Extend the calculation to ensemble models (random forest)
- Extract feature importance with scikit-learn

### Target
- Calculate the information gain result from a given decision tree split

### Stretch
- Calculate the feature importance manually from the information about all the decision tree splits
